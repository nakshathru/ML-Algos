      "VALUE OF S is I contacted Ally on Friday XX/XX/XXXX after falling behind on payments due to being out of work for a short period of time due to an illness. I chated with a representative after logging into my account regarding my opitions to ensure I protect my credit and bring my account current. She advised me that before an extenstion could be done, I had to make a payment in the amount of {$270.00}. I reviewed my finances, as I am playing catch up on all my bills and made this payment on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. This rep advised me, once this payment posts to my account to contact Ally back for an extention or to have a payment deffered to the end of my loan. With this in mind, I contacted Ally again today and chatted with XXXX. I explained all of the above and the information I was provided when I chatted with the rep last week. She asked several questions and advised me that a one or two month extension/deffered payment could be done however partial payment is needed! WHAT? She advised me {$230.00} or there abouts would be due within 10 days from me accepting the agreement and then the remaining bal of {$150.00} or there abouts would be due in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, my payments of {$380.00} per month would resume. If this was the case, I SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN OFFERED THIS WHEN I JUST MADE MY PAYMENT so that I could catch up on my bills. This company was working with XXXX in New Jersey which has since closed most likely due to illegal practices, they changed my loan company to this company after I had signed paperwork for another, kill you with interest rates and has NEVER once considered refiancing my vechile for a lower interest rate ( due to the age of the vechile other companies will not take it ) and THEY DO NOT WORK WITH YOU!\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Hello This complaint is against the three credit reporting companies. XXXX, Trans Union and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The response from XXXX and XXXX was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XX/XX/XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. I wrote XXXX and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only XXXX wrote back a letter dated XX/XX/2019 stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. Trans Union never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019 to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with TransUnion, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because XXXX, XXXX and Trans union all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I. I demand that these items on my account that was not verified be removed from my account because they are in violation of my rights and not to mention, Trans union did not even respond to my investigation request.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I am a victim of Identity Theft & currently have an Experian account that I can view my Experian Credit Report and getting notified when there is activity on my Experian Credit Report. For the past 3 days I've spent a total of approximately 9 hours on the phone with Experian. Every time I call I get transferred repeatedly and then my last transfer and automated message states to press 1 and leave a message and someone would call me. Every time I press 1 I get an automatic message stating than you before I even leave a message and get disconnected. I call Experian again, explain what is happening and the process begins again with the same end result. I was trying to have this issue attended and resolved informally but I give up after 9 hours. There are hard hit inquiries on my Experian Credit Report that are fraud, I didn't authorize, or recall and I respectfully request that Experian remove the hard hit inquiries immediately just like they've done in the past when I was able to speak to a live Experian representative in the United States. The following are the hard hit inquiries : BK OF XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I have a active XXXX XXXX credit card in good standing for many years. Sometime in the past year or so a negative XXXX card account had gotten added to my credit report. Ive disputed this several times with XXXX with proper documentation but they have failed to do anything about it. I cant even dispute it anymore because they have it permanently like they are still undergoing an investigation even though theyve updated it again with the same negative information but making appear newer. They have added remarks that dont even make sense. I do have copies of what they are doing along with my documentation that should had been read and looked at. The last time I had a payment it was due back in XX/XX/XXXX. I paid it early in XX/XX/XXXX. Also have proof of a new star card that was mailed to me back inXX/XX/XXXX. I do have copies where I had spoken with XXXX.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Receiving daily telephone call ( s ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX identifying themselves as from an attorney 's office and I am unable to decifer the name after asking 3 times. They ask me to confirm that my name is \" prior married name \". I ask what they want and they repeat the question. I responded yes and they hang up. The next call from that number was asking me if I was a different name - my maiden name which I recently change to. When I asked for clarification, they hung up. I have received a total of 6 calls in approx 2 days. They never divulge what they want after attempting to verify my name ( s )\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I have a bank of America small business credit card that I had requested to close. However it was not never processed and the bank charged me the annual fee and late payment fee for XXXX ( from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX ). I was out of USA during this period and once I returned I visited the branch in XXXX CA multiple times to get this resolved. I was told the charges will be removed but never got these removed so far. Hence I am raising the complain.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I opened a citi double cash card the beginning of XXXX and still have not received. They keep telling me they will resend a replacement card and still have not received it. They have told me that they have sent it out 3 times but yet still have not gotten the card. I have called to complain but they still havent resolved it. They wont overnight me the card. Its getting absurd at this point. I have never had so much grief for opening a credit card.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I am writing to inform you of the unfortunate set of circumstances that lead to my home loan ending up in a foreclosure.. I was laid off in XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX immediately after I was given the news that I was laid off.. I was concern for I was never late and I wonder if there was a program or any type of help that could help out until I found a job and make the new income adjustment work. I will never forget how this day has changed my life. I spoke to a customer service to a gentleman by the name of XXXX XXXX was very accommodating. He went on to tell me that there was nothing to worry about because the government had just signed \" bailout money \" for borrowers like me. He mentioned that in order to qualify for 2 % modification all I had to do was to miss three payments. I went home and told my husband and he was very reluctant. I went on and miss the payments. I did not hear anything from the bank for months. Shortly after I received a forbearance letter asking for all the money that I had missed. After paying the three payment on trial period the modification disappeared. The two subsequent payments were never found. I applied for a modification again four times. All documentation was sent in. I was denied four times with out an explanation. My marriage ended because all the stress. Since XXXX XXXX XXXX advised me to skip my mortgage payments, they quickly transferred the loan to XXXX and then to Shell point. I feel I was defrauded by my bank. I am also victim of predatory lending. I must comment that XXXX XXXX XXXX rewarded employees for denying applications and referring customers to foreclosure, according to the statement. A collector by the name of XXXX said who placed ten or more accounts into foreclosure in a given month received {$500.00} bonus. Other rewards included Gift cards retail stores or restaurants, said XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Who worked as a collector from XXXX to XXXX. original publication XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This loan was based on stated income and had apparently an inflated appraisal. I I am requesting the wet ink note be provided. Signature appears to be forged. I have done a forensic review. I also want an explanation about my note and mortgage which is owned by XXXX XXXX. Please explain to me how XXXX XXXX can maintain that they own the note if Shell point also is claiming ownership .I need this matter resolved.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I was initially contacted by XXXX XXXX in Fall 2016. Equitable Acceptance has partnership with XXXX XXXX/XXXX XXXX. These corporations are scam companies \" dealers '' for Equitable Acceptance. XXXX XXXX XXXX calls individuals and present a con/scam that they can enroll students in a special student loan repayment program. These corporations inform students that they qualify for loan forgiveness program and much lower monthly payments to their lenders ; which would ensure less payment out of student 's pocket and more loan being paid off/forgiven by the government. These corporations inform that the offer is only provided through their enrollment and the program enrollment will be ending soon. These corporations charge a fee for this service, in my case it was {$1800.00} in monthly direct debit amount of {$30.00} from my bank account. But these corporations convince students this is a great deal compared to how much they will save you from paying back to loan lender. Once an individual agrees to enroll in their scam program, they are connected to Equitable Acceptance to set up payment plan for their {$1800.00} document processing fee etc. Unfortunately, I fell for their scam. The documents are actually available FREE on department of education website, that students can complete themselves for no charge. These corporations were submitting false documents on my behalf indicating that my annual income is lower than it actually is. I never qualified for any of the programs that would result in student loans being forgiven. It only ended up costing me {$1800.00} and additional length on my student loan re-pay since they enrolled me in extremely low payback program. I want these evil scammers taking advantage of vulnerable students to stand trial for their crimes and be incarcerated. This scam needs to stop! I don't expect to see my {$1800.00} again as they are a fraudulent ponzi-scheme company. But I don't want them to continue in business getting rich off poor working students and ripping of Department of Education at same time if they continue enrolling individuals in re-payment programs that they don't qualify for.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My credit reports list monies owed to XXXX. I have written to the collection agency, XXXX XXXX XXXX requesting proof that I owe monies on this account, but none was ever sent. I notified the credit agencies that this creditor never sent me the required proof, yet they continue to list this account on my credit report. My credit reports list XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX for monies owed to XXXX. I submitted documentation that showed that the original creditor was paid However, the credit reporting agencies continue to list XXXX XXXX on my credit report. Furthermore, two separate collection agencies can not be listed on my creditreport over the same account. My credit reports list a bankruptcy that should have been deleted since the 7 years of reporting it has expired.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I have numerous inquiries on my credit report that I never authorized. I paid for Experian membership and cant review my credit report. The inquiries are from companies i have not seek credit from. Experian refuses to take identity thief seriously. Its bad enough they have let a collection agency stay on my credit report without really investigating. After the collection agency deleted the account several times Experian will not delete XXXX XXXX XXXX from my credit report. Inquiries are popping up on my credit report and i dont understand why and who is doing it.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is XXXX XXXX is reporting a balance that is incorrect and has been incorrect, going on 30 days now. I have contacted them and the credit reporting agencies and have not gotten anywhere.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/2020 I lost my wallet which resulted in debit and credit card fraud for all my accounts. I promptly reported to each bank and each bank provided provisional credit except for bank of the west. I was advised that I would receive a affidavit that I would need to sign. I received this affidavit which I immediately completed and signed. This was received on XX/XX/2020. This was confirmed by a telephone banking rep on XX/XX/2020. I was told on XXXX that the fraud department was closed and I would need to call Back. This is unacceptable that I need to chase my own money back as I have followed Bank of the wests requests. I am requesting immediate and permanent credit for the transactions. Its under {$100.00}, but its the principle and the frustration of having to keep following up with Bank of The West.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I have contacted Transunion an inordinate amount of times regarding updating my credit report after my Chapter XXXX bankruptcy discharge. They are listing accounts from XXXX XXXX XXXX as active accounts. These accounts were included in the bankruptcy years ago. There have been no new accounts or dealings with any company associated with XXXX XXXX. I should not have these items on my credit report any longer. I have sent in copies of my bankruptcy discharge papers as well as proof of my address and how long I've lived there. This has all been to no avail. I have asked several times to be provided with any data they have so that I may file an identity theft report if someone has in fact utilized my information without my consent. To date they have provided nothing. They continue to snd back computer generated letters stating the debts have been verified but according to the Federal Credit Reporting Act this is false. That to me seems unlawful. Therefore I filed a complaint with CFPB previously. You, too were unable to resolve this matter with Transunion. This is against the law. I have contacted this XXXX XXXX company over 30 times. They admit to having received my bankruptcy notification. Then when I ask to speak to a supervisor to assist in communicating this to Transunion, I am transferred around and mysteriously hung up on. This is all absurd and I will be filing lawsuit and complaint with the federal court with regard to the bankruptcy laws being violated within the next few days.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is XX/XX/XXXX {$1300.00} was reported being owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$840.00} was reported being owed to XXXX Virginia XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$1800.00} was reported being owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$150.00} was reported being owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$360.00} was reported being owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$430.00} was reported being owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Credit Control Corporation XXXX XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX XXXX ) and informed them that I had previously disputed this information via XXXX as this debt does not belong to me, but my dispute was unresolved due to there not being enough supporting information. Once I provided my name, she said \" that appears to be a really common name, can I have your date of birth ''? after providing her with my birth date, she says \" hmmm, that didn't narrow it down much, lets search by your social security number. '' So it is obvious that there are multiple accounts with the same name and date of birth as mine. I asked them what they needed of me, and was told that the debt is obviously mine, and I must have just moved from XXXX XXXX, where they sent my bills. I then informed the woman I was speaking with that I have never even lived on a XXXX XXXX She asked me for my current address and said she would be happy to send all the bills to me, but that is all. In XXXX, I encountered Identity theft. My debit card was \" skimmed '' according to the police department, since I still had physical possession of it. Then, when tax time came around, I received a bill from the XXXX with my name on it in addition to a \" XXXX XXXX '' whom I have never even heard of before. I filed an ID Theft report with them, and they fixed that for me as well. Now, I am having all of these medical bills show up in my collections history for XXXX 's offices that I have never even been to. I have asked multiple times for them to send me proper correspondence showing that it was \" actually me '' that obtained these services rendered, and to no surprise none of that is produced for me. I am trying to purchase my first home, and my banker said even though these accounts are showing \" closed '' there are still balances behind them, which is preventing me from obtaining my XXXX loan. She suggested reaching out to whomever I can to figure it out.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My spouse filed Ch. XXXX the first of XX/XX/2019, she is not on the mortgage and I did not include this loan in the settlement. Immediately after Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC received a courtesy notice of the spouses ChXXXX. They promptly pull account in into their bankruptcy section, tried to overcharge me for property taxes, which wife attorney called them on. Now they are charging me approximately {$1100.00} for their attorney fees for an account that was never officially include in the actual bankruptcy. I tried to call them a few week after the filing when I could no longer access my account online. The representative treated me like I filed for bankruptcy ( very poorly ) and said they are entitled to take such actions solely because Texas is a common law state. I asked if I could speak to a supervisor and they said one was not available and he would re state the same policy. I am a XXXX XXXX veteran and the purchase on my home has been the first benefit I have used after 20 years of service, this company has ruined this thus far. I feel this company is trying to seek fees and extort this situation just for profit, which is very concerning that is a common business practice for the 4th largest mortgage company in the USA.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Santander Bank took the opening deposit which was funded using a credit card on 9 accounts ( which were opened over the last 6 months ) between XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX. Each account had {$500.00} taken from it, which forced some accounts to go into a negative balance. I have received letters and phone calls from there collections department. However, I was never refunded the money on the credit card which had the opening deposit taken from it. If they are forcing the accounts to be negative, my credit card should have received refunds this occurred over 2 weeks ago. The bank refuses to talk to me unless I go in branch. When my husband did this, they wouldn't provide him with any information and told him to follow-up the next day. When he did they told him he had to go back to the branch. I am requesting the funds be sent to me immediately, any fees associated with being overdrafted, all accounts being closed, and additional money sent to me via check at the address on file. I was never notified that there was a limit to the number of accounts I could open or that I should not open up any new accounts. If they would have reached out to me I would have no problem not opening up any additional accounts. I have attached the 6 documents I received today that state my accounts are negative. There is additional documents I can not access due to having my accounts blocked\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Ive had a credit card with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for about seven years. I make my payments on line. The due date is XXXX of the month. In XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a {$100.00} payment to be taken out of my bank on XXXX XXXX. They gave me conformation number XXXX acknowledging receipt. A few days after the XXXX I checked to make sure payment posted only to find it was still in my bank account. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to check why and was switched over to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The woman I spoke with informed me that the two companies were in a transition period and my payment would be taken out soon without late fees. I waited 4 or 5 days and called again because it was still in the bank. I was told the same. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called and asked the women if she would just take the payment over the phone she agreed. I told her just to take that {$100.00} and I also scheduled another payment for XXXX, paying a total of {$200.00}. In XXXX they tacked on a late fee and started calling me saying I was behind a payment. In XX/XX/XXXX, a man called and requested {$120.00}, which I sent. They told me I had {$180.00} in credit. I used {$86.00} for my dentist and a XXXX XXXX XXXX payment. Now Ive received XXXX calls since Sunday telling me Im {$250.00} behind. Still because they wont credit me with my XXXX payment and back out all of the late fees. I asked the women why did you credit me with {$180.00} of credit and tell me Im {$250.00} behind. No answer. The woman I spoke with yesterday also told me they were a collection agency. I dont understand why the account went to collections in XXXX I was not behind on anything. I wrote a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX explaining my problem two months ago, got no reply. I cant get a phone number for the bank I keep getting XXXX, whose number is XXXX XXXX.

XXXX refunded late fees and interest to my account so that the balance was {$0.00}. XXXX and TransUnion will not change the status from Past Due to current even though I have provided statements showing the refunded fees. XXXX said the account is up to date in their system and not past due for XX/XX/2019. Their recommendation was to dispute with the agencies which I have done multiple times. I dont understand why XXXX updated the report and the others refuse. My credit score dropped significantly because of this.

      "VALUE OF S is I have discussed several accounting discrepancies with SPS but SPS has refused to make corrections to my account. SPS statements they mailed to me indicates that I owe XXXX XXXX dollars ( XXXX ) for property taxes, which is not true but they refused to tell me how they derived at that number. There are also charges that show XXXX charges for inspections with no details as to why, especially since I was not in foreclosure. I sent SPS a payment history to show that the billing was incorrect however they refused to stop the Auction of my home scheduled for XX/XX/2019. I filed a Notice of Error on XX/XX/2019 they have ignored the notice, even though they have opened an inquiry for research. They indicated they did not have to stop it because of the RESPA regulations did not apply to Dual Tracking for this incident. The notice of error stated numerous accounting errors by SPS, over charges and other erroneous charges from companies that I do not know that are on the SPS statement of charges sent out by the previous servicer and SPS. I also was charged for numerous inspections charges for my home when my home was not in foreclosure. I was charged BPO charges and legal fees when my account was in a current status. I am not sure of what the charges are that are on my account and why, but I asked that SPS give an accounting to why they continued to charge those incorrect amounts to my mortgage account when I have indicated they were incorrect many times. They are currently ignoring my request. I requested that SPS review my account and make corrections to my interest and my principle, they have refused to this date to do that. SPS on XX/XX/XXXX received a QWR they have refused to respond to my request, they indicated they will respond to it after my home is auctioned off which does not make a lot of sense to me. SPS has given erroneous information about the status of my account, I was told by several managers especially one that opened the research to verify the accounting errors on my account that the auction of my home would be postponed until that happened. Of course that was lies. I have requested several call backs from supervisor in the department of the Ombudsman and litigations no one will return the call. I requested that other executives in SPS ( any department ) return the call and address my inquiries and there has been no response, no call back and no evidence that they are willing to allow a workout plan. This has been blatant bullying and harassment from SPS with refusal to discuss with me the status of my account. The interest on my account is incorrect because of the erroneous charges therefore the principle is incorrect I have as for a pay-off and settlement which they withdrew which was a breach of the prior agreement in place. I have charges on my account for forced place insurance that need to be corrected and adjusted on my account.\n",

I ordered a bedroom set from a merchant \" XXXX XXXX '' on XXXX/XXXX/2019, and they charged my \" Synchrony Home Credit Card ''. I was promised delivery for the Bedroom Set on XXXX XXXX, 2019. First and foremost, XXXX XXXX was not authorized to charge my account until the merchandise was confirmed in-stock and ready for shipping. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was I was informed that the set was delayed until XX/XX/XXXX, then subsequently was told that they were unable to deliver the set as it is no longer available. I told XXXX XXXX, to cancel this order, and issue a refund to my Synchrony Home Credit Account, which should not have been billed in the first place, as they sold me furniture that was not available. On XXXX XXXX, 2019 I went into the store and they told me that they processed a full refund to my Synchrony Home Credit Card Account. After multiple calls to the store and Synchrony Bank, XXXX XXXX was telling me that they submitted the refund and placed the blame on Synchrony Bank being slow to post refunds. Synchrony Bank advised me that there was no refund issued, not was any refund pending. As a result, I disputed this charge as the merchandise was never delivered as promised and no refund was ever issued. Further, XXXX XXXX was not authorized to charge my card, until the merchandise was shipped. Synchrony bank closed the dispute in the merchant 's favor stating that they issued me a refund on a different credit card which is untrue, and the merchant nor Synchrony Bank are able to provide any supporting documentation.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I contacted Bank of America Visa to get help in an ongoing issue. It started last month at the same time on XX/XX/XXXX where I was notified that 5 charges were made in the amount of {$15.00} via XXXX. I contested charges last month and I was told by BOA Credit Card Services ( BOA CC ) that by closing my credit card ( CC ) account then the issue was resolved. They failed to tell me that they would still allow the carryover of charges ( even disputed ones ) to our new CC ( BOA failed to expedite the new CC despite our request and it took approximately one week to get a new CC ). We have numerous automatic charges so it took approximately 2 hours of my time to convert those charges to the new credit card received a week later ( New CC ). A month later the same 5 contested charges appeared on the New CC. We called XXXX who agreed to block the charges and confirmed that these contested charges were automatically transferred by BOA. Each charge was for XXXX- apparently BOA had done NOTHING to block these charges in XX/XX/XXXX- instead they failed to tell us it was up to us to contact XXXX to block and instead just transferred the charges despite this being the sole reason our CC was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. Because the New CC number was NOT compromised- there was no reason to do more than to dispute the charges. We contacted BOA as XXXX advised we had to do and explained the situation. As explicitly discussed during the call on XX/XX/2019, the instruction was not to cancel the new number as it had NOT been compromised. We were merely disputing the charges. However, we requested reimbursement of the approximately 80.00 in disputed charges. Our call was elevated to a supervisor named XXXX XXXX in the Rhode Island CC service center who was rude and abusive on the call resulting in escalated conversations. Throughout these conversations I was explicitly clear that I would NOT be closing the New CC and Ms. XXXX confirmed this fact including at the end of the call. Ms XXXX began to raise her voice as I repeatedly asked to ask a question but her demeanor changed rapidly and she because rude and condescending as she continued. Ultimately, I was able to tell her that I dont want to fight her but that we take care of this directly with XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat those monies myself so that this wouldnt be a fraud alert because after all, my new card was never compromised. I advised that I would contact XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat the monies myself so that my New CC remain intact- as the new card was never compromised. Regardless, I was shocked by her behavior and contacted BOA to lodge a complaint into Ms. XXXX temperament and rudeness. Hours later it is abundantly clear that Ms. XXXX went back into the account and closed it. This was clearly in retaliation for the complaint. Further, it appears that she failed to even dispute the charges at the center of this matter. This was clearly in retaliation for my complaint. Further, it appears that she failed to even dispute the charges at the center of this matter.The individual taking the complaint was a good kind agent named XXXX who advised me that this was actually a billing dispute and not a fraud alert and that she would dispute the charges referenced above. After this was completed, XXXX filed my complaint against Ms. XXXX. Approx. 4 hours later I received a panic call from XXXX. Ms XXXX had done the unthinkable. She cancelled my New CC despite 1 ). the card itself not being compromised and 2 ). my explicit instruction not to cancel it and affirmation of this instruction by Ms. XXXX. Obviously Ms. XXXX went ( unauthorized by me ) BACK into my New CC account and cancelled the card. The timing is very suspicious as it occurred shortly after my report of horrific customer service. Further, BOA failed to timely notify us that it had cancelled our New CC- and sitting here today, I do not know : 1 ). why it was closed despite the facts above ; 2 ). effective date of closure ; 3 ). if BOA is honoring our dispute of the XXXX charges ( not apparent in the online information ). This violates regulatory rules and ethics rules. We did not authorize the closing of the New CC nor did we authorize a disgruntled customer service supervisor the authority to go back into our credit card account and to take action. Please investigated and take action against BOA and Ms. XXXX.\n",

I informed them in XX/XX/XXXX that I did not owe the cooperative any money, and XXXX stated in XX/XX/XXXX that they would not get ( see attachment ) involved with any dispute between myself and the cooperative as the money alleged by the cooperative to be owing at the time was more than what was owed to XXXX. Furthermore one of the loans was paid off in XXXX ( see XXXX XXXX issued by XXXX -attachment ). Furthermore, I continued to pay both loans ( which is not clear which one if not both are on the credit report as one is depicted as current but still open and the other one is depicted as 120 days late with the same account number Account # XXXX ) The account with the XX/XX/XXXX open date is the one depicted as late ( Original Balance {$14000.00} with a Balance {$50000.00} ) however both should be closed. I never entered into an agreement to extend additional credit beyond the {$14000.00} owed on the original loan and XXXX has no right to extend such or charge such additional money to the account. I never received notification for what the {$50000.00} is for either. They further have changed my address to a XXXX address which is in fact the address of their attorneys XXXX XXXX further deteriorating my credit. Based upon information and belief it is also where they have been sending all my correspondence, as I have received no correspondence from them since XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore all payments to both accounts were made monthly with one check and there can be no way that payments were not applied to both accounts simultaneously other than that XXXX has been splitting up my payments and giving them to XXXX XXXX bank which has no authority to receive or accept my payments. See attachments of checks negotiated by XXXX XXXX but sent to XXXX.

      "VALUE OF S is This is my second complaint in only 1 day against TransUnion. I had 36 mistakes just this year in my file with TransUnion and I called so many times, they regularary hung up on me because they don't care. This time is that on XX/XX/XXXX, finally my score went up 69 points because I paid my credit cards. I did not know, being immigrant from XXXX, that in the USA, you should not spend more than 20 % of the amount of your credit cards limit. What's the point - it is so stupid. If you have an emergency, let 's say the dentist, you pay with your credit card, and it was not enough to be in pain because of a tooth, that you need to lose point from your credit score. - Where is the logic. In any event, I increased 69 points, but on XX/XX/2019, I lost 79 points for no reason that I can see, I did not spend on credit cards, I did not have a new debts. I called a supervisor in the USA, he did not give me his name, he told me that the reason is that I had two ACCOUNTS, yes two ACCOUNTS and they were merged and my score decreased of 79 points. I was fuming, how it is possible to have two accounts, it's not a bank account, it's my credit score linked with what? my Social Security Number. And as everyone else I have only one SSN. He told me that, of course, there's nothing else to do and he put an end at the conversation and hung up. If it's the case, that means that TransUnion only as Reporting Agency merged my XXXX Social Security Number with the USA ones. This is not acceptable, both countries has different laws and Credit Bureaus in XXXX are not important at all, certainly not like in the USA. By law in XXXX, our SSN can not be disclose easily, so if TransUnion used my SSN from XXXX, they are in an illegal position with XXXX. There's always a disclosure in XXXX on that card saying that this number and card belong exclusively to the Government. In any event, XXXX and USA are two different countries and totally two different court systems and different laws.

      "VALUE OF S is I have the Citi card for Costco. Costco sold me on getting the credit card because Citi is supposed to extend the manufactures warranty 24 months if the item was purchased at Costco. I purchased an XXXX XXXX waterproof camera XX/XX/XXXX for {$410.00}. While on vacation XX/XX/XXXX I took the camera on it's 2nd snorkel trip in water 3-4ft deep. The camera took pictures just fine but as we were leaving I noticed the screen looked foggy and water had slowly leaked in. The camera had leaked, destroying the camera. This is my 4th water camera so I am very familiar with making sure the seals are clean etc. It was the 2nd time I used the camera in water so it was evident it was a manufacturers defect. I called XXXX and they said they would cover it had it been within the 1 year period, since what I described was clearly the camera having a defect since it is supposed to be waterproof. I contacted Costco and they told me I was under the Citi warranty. I filed a claim with Citi and they have been beyond difficult about paying my claim. My claim was denied the 1st time because they claimed Costco Concierge service should cover my warranty. Well Costco doesn't cover cameras under that warranty. I would think Citi would know this since they partnered with Costco for this credit card, so I felt like I was getting the run around. They reopened my claim and denied it the 2nd time stating the camera got wet so it isn't covered. I explained to them again IT IS A WATERPROOF CAMERA. They opened my claim again and denied it a 3rd time stating again the camera isn't covered because it got wet. I explained to them again like I had since the very beginning of my claim that the camera is waterproof and I have contacted XXXX and they stated it is in fact covered under their 1 year warranty. XXXX said if salt water got in the camera they would just replace it for me because a repair would cost more than the camera. I explained all of this again the the Citi rep. Keep in mind they play dumb each time and act like they didn't know it was a waterproof camera etc, much like they played dumb they didn't know Costco doesn't have an extended warranty on cameras. The Citi rep told me if I could get XXXX to put in an email they they would cover it under the 1 year warranty he thought Citi would cover it. That was about 2 weeks ago and I haven't heard back. I had Costco Concierge services call Citi on Friday XX/XX/XXXX and they again said they are denying my claim. I have a valid claim that I opened with them in mid XX/XX/XXXX. I feel like I have gotten nothing but the run around in the hopes that I will give up and they get out of paying. The entire reason I got the Citi card was because Costco spoke so highly of it and how it extends warranties. I believe they are denying me a completely valid claim so this is why I am reporting it. My Citi claim number is XXXX\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I received a settlement check from a wrongful death suit involving my mother and the approximate total of the check was {$130000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. According to the Wells Fargo bank statement of XX/XX/XXXX, a deposit, of {$130000.00} was made into my Wells Fargo Access Fifty checking account. I spoke with a Financial Counselor representative at the bank that asked how did I come to have such a large check. I explained about the settlement. I only wanted to put that money in my personal checking account. I was told that I needed to open a savings overdraft protection account to avoid monthly fees and charges. I believed that was a separate account. This money was never deposited or linked to the overdraft savings account. Both accounts were online banking accounts of which I did not have access to a computer ; therefore, I was unable to check the accounts. No paper statements were sent to me. On XXXX XXXX, a withdrawal made in a Branch/store of {$36000.00} was made. I did not withdraw this money. On XXXX XXXX, a withdrawal made in a Branch/store of {$75000.00} was made. I did not withdraw this money. On XXXX XXXX, a withdrawal made in a Branch/store of XXXX was made. I did not withdraw this money. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was inquiring about a line of credit with Wells Fargo. The bank manager said I had to have a substantial amount of money in the bank for a line of credit. I said I do. She asked what account? I told her it was in my overdraft account. She said, What money in an overdraft account? I told her I put money in an overdraft saving account in XXXX. She said that their bank records do not go back that far, their retention period is only 7 years. However, she began to find and printed out an access fifty checking bank statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX. It verified a check totaling {$130000.00} was deposited on XXXX XXXX. Its showed a withdrawal of {$36000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$75000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$2500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The bank manager found several other accounts in my name of which I never opened or even knew about. I requested to see a signature page or signature of the withdrawal slip for those withdrawals. The bank manager said that information was not available since they only keep 7 years worth of information. I requested an investigation. She notified an escalation team of Wells Fargo. This team called me back in 5 days- they stated the retention policy was only 7 years and she could only find a bank statement starting with XX/XX/XXXX and no further information was available. I believe since the money can not be found or accounted for -identity theft, multiple accounts and a merger between Wachovia and Wells Fargo and Overdraft Protection Account, hid the removal of these monies.\n",

They offered several options but asked for permission to check my credit score. At this moment the score was about XXXX. However, Wells Fargo asked XXXX XXXX for assistance, and when results came, it was a very unpleasant surprise. The new FICO score has dropped for 83 points - due to the Wells Fargo/XXXX XXXX inquiry. When asked for information why it has happened, the answer was that this score is based upon XXXX report. I called XXXX and they denied providing such a wrong information. At this moment am disputing this sudden drop of the score and I am asking removal of such inquiry. As far as I know, the official credit bureaus are the only providers of credit information. Many new providers of scores are doing it for less money and are increasing the market. Their information is not always correct. They maybe are pleasing the lenders who are paying for information, but it can create harm to customers - intentionally or inadvertently.

I knew I didn't have an open account with Regions so I cent a certified letter to them which they received asking for information on the account because i didn't have an account with them. I never received anything further from Regions. I received an alert from a credit monitioring site stating that an account on my credit was just marke as 30 days late. I called Regions and they told me that I had a Streamline account and that the yearly fee had been assesed. I informed Regions that I no longer had a Streamline account with them and this account was closed months prior if not a year. I don't even have a checking/savings/or loan account with Regions anymore so I asked her how was it possible to have a fee assessed on a closed account. This streamline account was one that I was approved for {$500.00} that I could barrow money from the account and make monthly payments until the barrowed amount was paid back. Regions closed this account long before I left the bank totally. The account was in good standing and had been closed and updated on my credit file for several months to a year. I do not understand how this bank could charge a {$25.00} fee on a closed account that they closed and how could they add a 30 day late to an account that was closed but in good standings. How would I pay a yearly fee on an account that was closed, one that I didn't even have access to because it was closed and I don't bank with Regions since XX/XX/XXXX. The person I spoke with at Regions bank on XX/XX/XXXX stated the account wasn't properly closed which I don't understand wither because it was closed long before this happened and it showed on my credit report which I can provide to show that it was closed. I then proceded to ask the lady from Regions ok, clearly this was a mistake on REgions part so how do I rectify this incorrect information on my credit report that you all reported and she told me that she could send a note to her lead but this was something that I would have to take care of by disputing with the credit bureaus. Why could it be so easy to report incorrect information but not go back to update the credit bureaus with the correct information? This account was never late as it had been closed and in good standing. She removed the charges fromt the closed account said that she believed it wasn't properly closed which I don't believe is true because I showed on the Regions account that it was closed and it showe on the credit report that it was closed. Waking up to a 51 point drop in a credit score because of a mistake by Regions is not fair and then the Regions rep acted as if she didn't care. I have disputed this with XXXX and XXXX and it's not on XXXX and the account is as it should be on XXXX ( in good standings ).

For a number of reasons I believe this determination is unjust and inappropriate for my current financial situation and the current guidelines in place by XXXX XXXX to remove a cosigner. No where in the application does it state that I must have a certain dollar amount of income yearly to be approved for the cosigner to be removed, even with that being said I make a very decent amount of income for my age and debt- very easily making monthly payments. According the cosigner release form the guidelines to be met are of the following : I must complete the entire application, which I did. I must meet the age requirement of 18, which I have. Provide graduation completion documentation, which I did. Be a US Citizen, which I am and forever will be. Provide proof of income, I provided my recent pay stub along with my W2- with a very reasonable income. Be current on my service loans and with in the past 12 months, which I have been in repayment for over a year now and have never missed a payment. The next is demonstrated a satisfactory payment history for the last 12 months. And finally no student loans in hardship or forbearance, which I have never had. They did state they would run a credit report the support the fact that I will be able to assume full responsibility for repayment of loans and to make sure there are no signs of bankruptcy, open foreclosure, student loan default or delinquencies. So at meeting all these guidelines and applying, I had no concerns of having my application not being accepted. Then when I received the form on XX/XX/XXXX stating my income was unsatisfactory, I strongly disagreed. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested a form from transunion to dig further into why I may have not been accepted. The same time I had called and spoke to XXXX XXXX about it and the representative told me that I had no grounds to dispute the subject. I am currently awaiting a response from TransUnion on the grounds that they used my old income to calculate the report versus the W2 I had submitted. I have a decent credit score and steady income, currently I have no assistance from the cosigner on my loans and am making payments in full.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Amerisave Mortgage ( also operating under aliases like XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) My experience with Amerisave was horrific. They wasted 9 weeks of my time, {$1500.00} ( not including the extra {$500.00} for the appraisal ), hard hit my credit report under AmeriSave on XX/XX/19 and XX/XX/19 and the above aliases twice on XX/XX/19 ( which I was told not to worry about because my loan officer would \" remove those '' and \" it was just something they have to do on their end to help people out and it would RAISE my credit score '', when infact it lowered my score. They intentionally performed multiple hard hits, in order to require me to find alternate ways to \" pass underwriting ''. I began the process with AmeriSave and paid {$500.00} for the \" loan application fee ''. Inwas informed that AmeriSave charges that fee upfront to prevent people who weren't serious in obtaining a home loan from AmeriSave and not \" waste their time '' and the {$500.00} went towards paying for the appraisal of my home upfront. So, throughout this process, which I was \" guaranteed '' to be at the closing table within 15 days \" no problems '', AmeriSave manifested reasons why I couldn't qualify in order to continue charging me {$500.00} for additional processing times without informing me. My loan officer asked me if anyone could be a \" non-occupant co-borrower ''. My ex-husband agreed to be the non-occupant co-borrower as long as he would not be on the AmeriSave loan or required to be financially liable in the event I defaulted. My loan officer ensured him, 1. He would not be on the loan, his income was only propping my income up and helping me qualify 2. His credit would not be pulled or effected and 3. Adding him was all that was necessary for underwriting to approve the loan and I would be at the closing table within 5 days. Ofcourse, those three things did not happen and AmeriSave, without authorization charged another {$500.00} to add him as a non-occupant co-borrower. My appraisal had already been completed, so there was no need for another {$500.00} charge. Then, my loan officer told me that underwriting asked if my ex-husband would agree to be a full co-borrower and if so, underwriting would immediately approve to fund my loan, and in 6 months, AmeriSave would just \" drop him off the loan '' as long as I had no late payments. My ex-husband agreed to be a full co-borrower. AmeriSave then charged another {$500.00} without my knowledge or authorization. When the credit card payment came due, I looked at the itemized charges and this is when we noticed all the {$500.00} extra charges. I immediately contacted my loan officer by email and phone. Suddenly, after weeks of daily calls and emails, I was unable to reach my loan officer. He ignored me for over a week. Finally, I received a call from my loan officer and he informed me that 1. Each time he made changes to my original application, {$500.00} was charged so that I wouldn't pull out of the process which would've wasted their time and hardwork put in 2. Each time a change was done AmeriSave had to pull my credit but for me not to worry when I saw the multiple hard hits under aliases as well, because those would be removed 3. AmeriSave was not going to resubmit my loan application with my ex-husband as a full co-borrower because underwriting had already flagged my loan as a denial, so it would be a waste of time. He then said he wished me luck. When I tried to address getting {$1000.00} refunded for the \" additional '' loan changes, he abruptly ended the call and told me, \" XXXX, do not contact me again, you're not getting anything back, anything refunded, and the hard hits will remain on your credit since you are harassing me and AmeriSave. '' After trying to go above his head, I was ignored. After weeks of promises, AmeriSave simply kept manifesting false reasons of why my loan was getting kicked back from underwriting, just to charge me more money. AmeriSave is nothing but a scam. My new lender informed me of the legal process and gave me this website to report my complaint against AmeriSave. I noticed in your database that AmeriSave has multiple complaints and resolutions. I hope you can help me resolve mine. One more addition, my first loan officer was honest and local. Soon after, I was told that loan officer was no longer with the company and my new loan officer was located in Georgia ( I live in Texas ).\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I have sent out a method of verification request to the credit bureaus and all they have sent back to me was the account was verified, or that they have updated information in my credit file with the note : NOT SPECIFIED. I then sent another dispute letter regarding all incorrect, inaccurate, unverified information on the account \" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ( XXXX ). The creditor has \" updated the information. I recently I have noticed that Experian has not shown any time that I have disputed information with them in the past. XXXX has stated that they do not provide the documents that are required for proper verification. So I am lost, if the FCRA indeed states that method of verification is indeed the credit reporting agency obligation, then why come XXXX, Experian, and XXXX can tell me anything different?\n",

I sent it to my mortgage company which was XXXX XXXX XXXX, certified mail only to find out I was no longer with XXXX and that Shellpoint Mortgage was now serving my loan. I have been in bankruptcy for the past 2 years and was never notified this change that took place. Which in fact is the mortgage companies responsibility to let the insurance company know of the change. I had my roof repaired on XX/XX/XXXX and sent the check out certified to XXXX XXXX where XXXX XXXX was located not yet aware of the change The check was than forwarded 2 times in XXXX AZ, 2 more times in XXXX XXXX XXXX and then 1 more time to Ohio where Shellpoint is located. After all of that they could not endorse the check due to their name not being on it and sent it back to me with the wrong return address on it and it ended at a lawyers office in XXXX and they in turn forwarded it to me. This took about 2 plus weeks. How could my NEW mortgage company not know my address. I recently sent the re-issued check and I need it signed immediately so I can pay the contractor that fixed my roof. This has been 6 weeks this man has been waiting to be paid. Everyone is experiencing difficulties at this time and he sure could use this money I owe him. Shellpoint is pathetic and I would like some help if possible. I have contacted the XXXX and I have read complaints regarding similar things that other people have experienced with them also. Thank you for your time.\n",

I explained the issues to the owner and he agreed to inspect and give me a written estimate on how much it would cost to repair. I told him I have a limit of {$800.00} to pay for the repairs and wanted a written estimate 'before any work was to be completed. Instead, the owner went ahead and done the work \" without prior authorization according to Florida Statute when a written estimate is asked by consumer ( me ). I received a phone call from the owner stating the repairs was done and the bill was fraudulently written to cover the {$800.00} limit.

I wasn't given any written estimate or document from the owner that gave him permission to do work that amounted to the {$800.00} the owner stated I owed when I went to the shop to get my van. Instead, I had to pay the full amount {$800.00} ( {$500.00} on bank card wells Fargo ) and {$300.00} in cash which I had to withdraw from my checking account. Otherwise the owner would impound my vehicle until the {$800.00} was paid in full. I only had a {$500.00} daily limit on charges with my bank card and had to swipe the debit card from my checking account. Then pay {$300.00} cash in order to get my van released. There was no documentation presented to Wells Fargo Bank from XXXX XXXX XXXX owner \" XXXX '' to prove I authorized the repairs made on XX/XX/XXXX, nor was a written estimate was provided by the owner \" as requested by me which all consumers have a right under Florida Statute \" to receive a written estimate prior to any work being performed by any licensed automotive repair facility. This repair shop violated this right that is guaranteed by Fla. Stat.

However, Wells Fargo \" had no documentation to prove the {$500.00} was authorized by me with my legal signature or made any attempt to get the copy of the written estimate that was requested by me prior to any work to be performed. Instead, Wells Fargo reversed my {$500.00} provisional credit which left my checking account to be overdrawn and subject to being closed. This consumer kept arguing that there is no documentation to prove I authorized the {$800.00} repair bill no signature by me or written estimate. Then the argument I had to pay the unauthorized charges in order to get my van out of impound \" so i can return to work. The van was used for business and was necessary to keep working. I submitted complaints with Wells Fargo and the XXXX XXXX XXXX based on fraud charges and not following state statute which Wells Fargo refused to submit a proper complaint with Visa so they can do a proper investigation of my claims. Instead, Wells Fargo closed my checking account because I refused to repay the {$490.00} overdraft fee until Wells Fargo takes my complaint seriously. Wells Fargo Failed to cooperate and submit proper documentation that the {$800.00} was authorized even though the evidence proved otherwise. Wells Fargo failed to protect me against fraud by not properly investigating my complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX owner.\n",

I feel this is very strange and I did not authorize this nor did I commit fraud. I feel this is a negative commentary that I don't deserve. about 6 weeks ago, I received a box from XXXX XXXX and opened it to find that XXXX XXXX had sent me 2 brand new in the box XXXX XXXX. I did not order, I was not a customer of XXXX, and I did not really know what to do.

I asked for the manager XXXX, and he helped me, he took both phones and sent them back. I have copies mailing documents that XXXX said indicated acceptance of the phones.

Please note that the identifying information they provided in the XXXX request on XX/XX/XXXXhas my name and address but the number is not mine. Never was mine, and is an apparent indicator of fraud and a possible link to the perp.

When I called they notified me that there were {$2500.00} in cash advances taken out on my credit card in CA. I live in Ohio. There were also charges of {$50.00} each of two item transfers. There must have been some other fees because the total balance was {$2600.00}. I told them to immediately close those accounts. Shortly after that I received two checks from Wells Fargo. One was for {$1200.00} the other one was {$71.00}. Attached to the check was a note stating that I had not fulfilled my obligation to Wells Fargo. Due to the fact that when I called the fraud department several times and they refused to give me any information on the account, I am assuming that the money they sent me was from the accounts that were opened that not been used by whoever opened at the accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that because I closed that account they can not reverse the online transfer. Therefore, there will be no adjustment made to my bill and the claim is now closed. I have now closed all of my accounts with wells fargo including the new credit card they sent me because of the fraudulent charges on the old card. According to this letter they are holding me responsible for {$2600.00} for all of the fraudulent charges that were made on my credit card account. Wells Fargo notified me that there were fraudulent charges on my account while before I even received a bill for them. I had not used this credit card for at least over a year. After them notifying me there was fraudulent activity I received the monthly statement proving that they were correct in telling me that there was fraudulent activity. Obviously, the bank realizes that I did not make these charges but yet are putting them on my bill and making me pay for them. When I closed those accounts I was not notified that this would affect the fraud claim. The reason I closed those accounts was because I was afraid there would be more fraudulent activity.\n",

I was told that my account was not settled and that they would refer my account to collections. When I asked what the charge was from they said it was my tuition.

I completed the forms, had them notarized, and submitted them via registered mail to the Bank of America office in XXXX, CA ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA ). I was notified by Ms. XXXX on or about the week of XX/XX/2019 that she received the paperwork and that I would have a decision within 30 days. After a number of follow-up attempts with Bank of America, with absolutely no response from them via email or phone, I was finally contacted today by XXXX XXXX in the same department. She notified me over the phone that the loan was deemed a non-fraud case, which is an absolute farce, because I never authorized the loan. As importantly, Bank of America did not notify me, neither through phone nor mail nor email that the case had been resolved. I had to leave numerous non-returned voice mails before someone contacted my back on XX/XX/2019. Bank of America maintains that I owe them for a loan I did not make nor had any part of. This has negatively affected my credit and prevented me from obtaining credit. Additionally, Bank of America sent me a harassing letter maintaining that I need to register a vehicle that I don't own nor have ever seen in the state of Georgia, or be in default of the loan terms.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is In early XX/XX/2019 I noticed an entry from The XXXX XXXX on my credit report. I sent a certified letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that letter was received on XX/XX/XXXX. In the letter I stated there was an entry for {$620.00} on my credit report and just to simply get this off my report that I would pay {$310.00} which was half of the debt that was mentioned on my credit report. In the letter I also stated that cashing the check the company would be agreeing to completely remove this off of my credit report with all 3 bureaus and not report this as a paid collection or settled account. The check was cashed by a Continental Finance and when I check my report the entry was completely removed. I was alerted on XX/XX/XXXX that a company by Continental Finance has placed a charge off on my account for {$310.00} which appears to be the other half of the debt that was reported on my credit report. This seems to be a sister company to XXXX XXXX XXXX. So essentially, my money was taken and XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed to the terms of deleting this from my credit report and did indeed removed but turned back around and fraudulently had a sister company list this on my credit report. If there was an issue agreeing to the terms then the check should have never been cashed and a verification letter should have been sent to me and it was not. I have never had any dealing with Continental Finance so I'm not sure why they even have this account and further they are also operating as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, so there appears to be 3 companies operating as one for this purpose. Since the company cashed the check they have agreed to have this completed removed from my credit report so it should not be there and I have kept all documentation. This company should be investigated to see how many consumers they are doing this to. In addition, they should be looked into to ensure that they are abiding by the SCRA ( Servicemembers Relief Act ) laws for XXXX XXXX members of 6 % percentage rate, I don't believe this company is following the law in regard to that and I'm curious how many other XXXX XXXX members are affected by that as a whole.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I was summoned on XX/XX/19 for a pre trial mediation on XX/XX/19. The law suit claims that XXXX XXXX is the plaintiff but the documents show that Pollack & Rossen, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Florida, XXXX are the actual plaintiffs. The summons itself is a cut and paste document poorly done. Once googled they are notorious and have had class actions against them. By law XXXX XXXX would have charged of this debt in 180 days of non payment. I suspect they purchased the debt and by using XXXX XXXX as plaintiff is fraud, a practice for which they have been sued for in the past. I am no stranger to this tactic as a business owner for over 35 years. Mediation is to see what assets I have, such as homes stocks etc. which I have none. I am a XXXX year old retired single man living on social security. Their threats for garnishing wages, seizing bank accounts and property are disturbing to say the least.

      "VALUE OF S is I received a notice from XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX that I was behind with one of my accounts and so I logged in and it was my mortgage company, M & T Bank. I had made all of my payments on time and even paid XX/XX/2019 payment in XX/XX/XXXX. I went through my bank statements just to make sure and yes, I had made every single payment, there just was not one listed for XX/XX/XXXX because I made it on XX/XX/2019. I emailed the company on their website listing dates and amounts that were paid ( I have attached a copy of the email and their response ) The XX/XX/XXXX payment was made on XX/XX/2019 for the payment amount of {$490.00}. The payment I tried to make early for XX/XX/XXXX was paid on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$560.00}. I paid extra to pay down late fees that I have incurred. Imagine my surprise when in the response from the bank, they told me that they did not show me making a payment of {$490.00} on XX/XX/2019. She asked me to fax the information over if I had proof otherwise which I did on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX, I am attaching the fax confirmation sheet. On Friday, XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from the bank dated XX/XX/2019 stating that they will investigate and let me know what they find. The letter states that I owe for XX/XX/XXXX ( which I do not ) and now it is XX/XX/XXXX and I owe for XX/XX/XXXX also. My credit report shows that I did not make a payment for XX/XX/XXXX, which is false, I sent them a statement from every month showing all of the payments I made. I also had a problem with my mortgage insurance and had to get new. My new company sent them the information in XX/XX/2019 to have insurance begin XX/XX/2019 and to be put in escrow. The company did not pay the bill for the escrow and beginning XX/XX/2019 raised my payment to include their insurance. My payment went from {$490.00} a month to {$780.00}. They would not accept payment for the mortgage only and did not pay the escrow for that. So I went back to the insurance agency and did a new policy that began in XX/XX/2019 but I still had to pay the outrageous amount of {$800.00} because they still did not pay the escrow and I had bounced a check so I added the {$20.00} to that payment, which I told the girl when I called that is what it was for, and yet it still shows I owe a {$20.00} NSF fee which I have attached a copy of my online account because it also STILL shows I owe for XX/XX/XXXX and now XX/XX/XXXX. As of today, XX/XX/2019, they have not paid my insurance to escrow and it will be cancelled on XX/XX/2019 if they do not. I have gone back and forth with this company and they are never willing to help even when it is their fault. I can't afford to pay XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and so I will be going into default soon.

Prior to M & T obtaining the loan around XXXX or XXXX, we were in the process of a repayment plan with XXXX to catch up on a missed payment of the mortgage on our house. During this process we were verbally told by XXXX that our loan would remain in good standing as long as the catch-up payments that were kept current which they were. We missed 1 payment during the entire year of XXXX but it shows on our credit report as it was consistently late for more than 5 months. We contacted M & T and they assured us that everything was fine and we were in good standing. In late XXXX of XXXX, our home in XXXX XXXX suffered a tremendous loss due to extreme water damage from the pipes bursting and completely flooding all 3 levels of our home. Our home had over {$200000.00} dollars of repairs done that took several months longer than projected due to M & T withholding the funds and paying the contracting company in a timely manner which was agreed upon between the 2 companies. Needless to say the process was very stressful. We still continued to keep the mortgage payments in good standing. Since all of this has transpired, the mortgage loan was paid off early and in full in XXXX of XXXX due to the sale of the home this loan was associated with.

      "VALUE OF S is Around XX/XX/2018, there was were faulty plumbing, wiring, and heating unit issues in the property I was renting/leasing at the time. I was told by the landlord that it would get taken care of immediately. It never get taken care of, as a result, the electric bill for one month alone was over {$1000.00} due to these faulty issues. The landlord was supposed to pay this bill, since it was his fault. However, instead this was charged to me. I was not informed this would affect my credit, but since I could not get any hep from the landlord, I did my best to pay this debt anyway. I never received any notice that this would be transferred to collections. However, when collections did call me earlier this year, I still attempted to settle the debt by getting on a payment plan for the sake of my credit. They told me that this would not be reported negatively on my credit report if I began a payment plan. So I proceeded. I have discovered that that they STILL reported negatively on my credit report, and this is hurting me terribly. All this for a debt I do not even owe. I can not get any help on this matter from the company collecting the debt currently listed on my credit report CREDIT MANAGEMENT LP. I also could not get help from XXXX XXXX XXXX who initially charged me such an outrageous bill from a faulty home that the landlord was supposed to repair. I was never even notified in writing about the outstanding balance or that it would be sent to collections.

I was unable to speak to anyone in accounting who would know what a stop payment ment and how to implement that process. I sent letters, I called several times but all I got was a letter saying they had the right to choose the amount of credit. No answer to the fact they did not seek my approval for that amount and the fact I never agreed to their terms. I see this as a fraud. Get people to apply for a loan, give no info on the amount or terms and only allow them to speak to customer service who is not equipped to handle these issues. I wrote a letter, sent back the statements with notes but they refused to intelligently address the issue. What I need now is to have First Bank remove their reporting to the top 3 credit reporting agencies.FYIi XXXX cashed the check on XXXX\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I am very concerned about the validity and accuracy of the recent investigation done by Transunion. I requested for an investigation because the accounts have nothing to do with me. I am a victim of identity theft and the accounts are not my responsibility.

      "VALUE OF S is Curious about my credit score, I obtained a copy of my credit report. Upon examination of the report, I noticed that there were some inaccurate items that should not be there.

I never received any type of verification of any kind. All that was sent to me was a letter saying that the supposed debt had been verified and that it was accurate according to them. Waiting over 30 days ( which is how long that is legally allowed to verify any disputes ), I then sent another letter on XX/XX/18, which was received on XX/XX/18 ( again, certified with return receipt ), stating that I had still not received verification of any kind, let alone any type of verification that was bearing my signature, as I had requested. Upon checking my credit report, the non-verified, inaccurate item is still on my credit report, causing a negative effect on my credit score, as well as public humiliation throughout my local community. Since no verification of any kind has ever been sent to me or provided, I am seeking that this particular inaccurate claim is removed immediately. Not only has no information bearing my signature ever been provided when requested, but is also Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act - including but not limited to Section 611, such as : -FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) -FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) Depending upon how this matter is handled, I will also be detailing any potential issues via an online public press release, including any documentation of potential small claims action.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is My complaint is specifically with Experian. First of all it is impossible to talk to a human being, I tried several times and even tried a hack on the Internet ( pushing XXXX instead of XXXX ) and none of them work. I tried to temporarily lift a freeze on my bureau so I could apply for a loan. I tried online and it refuses to accept my User Name and Password ( I know it is correct because I wrote it down and place in my safe when I put the freeze on ). When I ask to have my user name emailed to me it accepts but I never receive the email ( requested XXXX times over the past 12 hours ). I call the \" Customer Service '' number and I get a machine. The machine permanently removed the freeze instead of temporarily suspending it. I tried to fix and since it is impossible to talk to a person I was unable to do so. This company needs to be put on your hit list to fine billions of dollars like you do the banks! At least banks have a customer service department that tries to actually help their customers. Credit Bureau 's seem to think they are immune to any sort of responsibility to their customers! This has got to stop!\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I took out my XXXX XXXX loan in order to go to college. I was told when I signed up that I would get the best customer service. However, ever since I have graduated in XX/XX/XXXX, I have had nothing but trouble from them. They immediately came after me for {$550.00} a month. I was able to get my account placed on a Graduate payment plan, but once it ended, I still was struggling to make payments as a recent graduate. When I contacted them, in XX/XX/XXXX and requested assistance in the form of refinancing due to an increase in my credit score, they refused and instead they placed me on an interest only repayment plan for {$300.00} a month, despite the fact that my cosigner had amazing credit. After that, they would make disrespectful, harassing and occasionally threatening calls to myself and my cosigner, who was in the hospital during one of these calls. While I understand that they are a business, these calls came when I was only two days late in payment, and when I had already called XXXX XXXX and informed them that I was waiting on a paycheck and then they would get their money. At one point, the person I spoke with talked down to me and told me that until I \" learned to pay on time, I would continue getting the calls. '' Again, this would occur when I was only two to five days behind in payment on a {$300.00} dollar payment as a recent graduate. I have never been more than 28 days past due, and every time I have been past due has been due to some reason I can't control and that XXXX XXXX refuses to work with me on. Now, after a year of these \" interest only payments '', my repayment plan is almost up and at the beginning of this year, my balance went up {$8000.00} and they expect me to begin paying them {$550.00} a month come XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. Every time I request some form of help due to being unable to handle the bill and support myself, they refused. I have no issues paying my bills, I am an accountant and I know bills must be paid. However, there is absolutely no reason that XXXX XXXX should be this inconsiderate and all together disrespectful towards their clients.\n",

My insurance company did not pay the full value of the car nor did I have Gap insurance as I was told I had. I never thought to check the information but found out the hard way after my car was totaled out. Insurance then pushed me to get a new vehicle or be without a car or get a rental at my own expense. I spoke with the Avid Acceptance whom told me they would not finance me until my current loan was paid off. I had to go through another company to get a car for my family, clothes, place to live etc. XXXX has been calling my boss stating that I gave her as a personal reference apparently she gets so many calls she begged me to call him, and tell him to stop calling her. I was not made aware that I could make this complaint or even if something will be done about it. I just need him to stop calling my boss. I have tried to negotiate to get this debt taken care of but what I can afford and what they want me to pay are two different things.

XXXX XXXX had the mortgage. The transfer of the mortgage was never recorded in XXXX XXXX records. Then, in XXXX Aurora loan services recorded an assignment of mortgage from XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX to XXXX. The assignment was supposedly executed in XXXX and the XXXX companies involved did not have the mortgage. The documents were never recorded in XXXX XXXX records until another mortgage company by the name of Aurora loan services bought the mortgage. Since it is supposed to be recorded in XXXX XXXX records within a certain amount of time in relation to the closing date, I feel these companies have acted fraudulently. The assignment of mortgage was allegedly signed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX. The assignment was not recorded in XXXX XXXX records of XXXX until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Where did this document sit for all that time? This document supposedly sat in limbo and then mysteriously appeared in XXXX, when Aurora loan services bought the loan.

      "VALUE OF S is Took out a installment loan which has, like most loans, a payoff amount which reduces the amount of interest that I pay out during the duration of the loan.

On XX/XX/XXXX I took out an installment loan from Worth Finance, the business is located on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Texas [ XXXX ] XXXX, I've been making all my payments on time. At times I've made bulk payments in the amounts of anywhere from {$300.00} to {$400.00}, figuring that the payments were bringing down the loan amount minus interest. Interest is added after the bulk payments has changed the loan amount. What Worth Finance has been doing, they've used the bulk payments as monthly payments, by doing that they have been collecting interest @ 86 % and never adding the bulk payments to reduce the loan amount. As you can see, if a customer pays out the loans early, they, Worth, losses interest. The contract that I signed makes no mention that they have the right to do that. If they would like to do such a thing I must be notified in writing, which I have not ever seen, much less received. It's in clear violation of the contract.

In the fine print you agree to things that Im sure help them get by with it. Like you agree that everything we provide is accurate and true. I didnt feel comfortable with that obviously. So I told them on the phone I wanted a copy sent to my email of the payment history and balance history. So after 24 hours I get the email and once again it says, log in to your account to view your documents you asked for. I am not going to fall for their tricks. I just want a fair report and honesty. Im currently in the middle of trying to refinance my home, my credit score was XXXX and it was going to drop my payments roughly 200 dollars. Now I cant. It got dropped 90 points. All of this has cost me so much time and money that I will never get back.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I looked up a property in XXXX XXXX, FL. I called the number from XXXX XXXX XXXX and obtained information via phone. The so called owner agreed to sign a 2 year lease ; we completed background checks and filled out the lease agreement, sent images of our licenses and signed. So called owner was to ship the keys to us but there was a delay with the husband stating that he found another party that was willing to pay 6 months in advance. We agreed to give an additional 2 months of rent which in term he agreed as well. After we transferred money to their lawyer they told us they sent the keys and would be getting back to us with a confirmation from XXXX. We did not receive word from them after that. We tried calling their number and it was disconnected. My boyfriend did some research and found the actual owner of the property through a property appraisal website and contacted him to verify his identity which did not match the so called owner we had been in contact with. The so called owners sent us a California Drivers License ( XXXX XXXX, DOB-XX/XX/XXXX ) We also have all the text messages sent/received between us. The so called owner also sent post office images to us as if they were going to mail keys to us.\n",

According to MyFico score reports, XXXX & Transunion showed a 30 day late status for XX/XX/XXXX, while XXXX showed a 30 day late status for XX/XX/XXXX. See attached. I disputed the account history in order to have the report corrected, and at that time, XXXX XXXX XXXX appears to have added another 30-day late status to each of my reports. I only paid this account late one time. In fact, every single other payment aside from that one were made early. If that's not the case, I'd like XXXX XXXX XXXX to furnish documentation to prove otherwise.

I immediately contacted the management office and requested they send the maintenance supervisor and a crew member, along with the apartment complex manager, to investigate the roofing issues, as well as the other defects in the unit. I was assured by the apartment complex manager that these issues would be immediately resolved. The numerous repairs to the unit were never completed. Consequently, I had no choice but to vacate the premises. Due to the numerous repairs that were needed to the unit I was assured by the complex manager that I could vacate the property and that I would be released from the lease and that no collection action would be taken. The apartment complex did not honor their word. The supervising manager fired not only the apartment complex maintenance manager, but the crew member who initially investigated the material defects in the unit. I do not owe any outstanding balance and this false reporting of a collection is seriously harming my credit score. I have tried to contact the management company, as well as the bureaus to remove this collection however, I have not been successful. This line item needs to be removed from my credit report.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX City/ State/ Zip : XXXX, DE XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX Re : Acct # XXXXXXXXXXXX To Whom It May Concern : I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX Vs. XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in theXX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at XXXX. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s. You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. I intend to follow through with the suit if I do not hear back from you within 15 days. I look forward to hearing from you, Thank you.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Received call from XXXX XXXX XXXX representative stating I did not pay for the loan that was taken out on XX/XX/2018. I have previously taken payday loans from this company and have paid for all of them but this one was not me. I did not receive any emails or notification that a loan was taken out and I checked my bank account and funds were not deposited into my account. I logged in to the website and the bank account associated to my account is not mine. I don't know how it was changed and advised the representative that this was fraud. They advised me to log into a website to submit a fraud request which I did. Within a week I received fraud paperwork which I filled out and send to them. On XX/XX/18 I received a communication from XXXX XXXX XXXX advising that this debt is now been acquired by another company and I am now receiving collection calls from a debt collection agency. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/18 and advised I had opened a fraud case and of the communication I had received and they advised me they would have a fraud representative contact me in 48 hours. I have not received anything from them and continue to receive phone calls.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I Have been under a chapter XXXX that was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. The HELOC loan I have was with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I got a letter from them dated XX/XX/XXXX saying that they have sold my HELOC loan to Specialized Loan Servicing LLC and that they are taking over the loan on XXXX.I am suppose to close on my refinance on XX/XX/XXXX. I have contacted Specialized Loan Servicing daily for the past week and they can not provide a payoff amount yet and are now telling me that instead of XXXX which they originally said they could, now they are saying XX/XX/XXXX!! I also have not received a welcome package from them yet telling me where to send my payment due on XX/XX/XXXX if I end up having to make it, although XXXX XXXX XXXX did say I could get it to them and they would forward it to them. I am concerned about that because of all the bad reviews I see on SLS LLC, as far as them posting payments on time and then charging late charges on those payments that were indeed paid on time. I just want to be able to close my refinance on XX/XX/XXXX as we have planned and am hoping you can urge them to get my payoff amount sent to our loan officer. I can not believe they can't look up that information and get it done for me.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is XXXX has continued to report an account which I previously held with them as a derogatory account to the various consumer credit reporting companies. I have disputed the status of the account with the Credit Reporting Agencies, as well as directly with XXXX without success. XXXX contends and reports that the account was included in a bankruptcy filing, thus reporting the account as a negative or derogatory mark/tradeline on my consumer credit reports, however this is in fact, untrue. The account that I held with XXXX was in good standing and maintained a zero balance from the date that it was opened until the date it was closed by the creditor. The account was not discharged or even included in the Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy I filed as there was never any debt to discharge. As I have previously disputed this account with the Credit Reporting Agencies, some of them have deemed any further disputes erroneously as frivolous due to XXXX 's insistence that they are accurately reporting, therefore precluding me from any further disputes of that information. The account was closed by XXXX unilaterally and should be reported solely as closed by grantor, without any negative remarks or connotations that cause it to be classified as a derogatory account which can negatively impact my credit score. This account is specifically reported on my TransUnion and XXXX reports. XXXX shows it inaccurately as included in Bankruptcy ( negative ) last updated in 2014. Even after a dispute with both the CRA and the creditor, even though they report it as never having a balance.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My loan is currently in active foreclosure due to the negligence of several collection representatives with Loancare. On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed in a loss mitigation application along with a payment of {$1000.00}. My payment was posted and applied to XX/XX/XXXX, so I reasonably assumed that my loss mitigation documentation was received and processing, since my check was received and deposited. I have sent Loancare a copy of the tracking information for the mail that was sent, along with a copy of the application. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I initiated an electronic payment from my XXXX XXXX Checking account for XX/XX/XXXX payment. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that the payment was received and I was told by a representative that the payment was there, but that it was being rejected because it was not enough. I told her I would wait for it to reach my bank. I inquired about my loss mitigation paperwork and she said she did not see it. When I called on XX/XX/XXXX to check the status of my payment, I spoke with a young woman who told me she did not see an electronic payment and that my paperwork was most likely shredded and that I should resubmit. I asked her if it was the company policy to shred misdirected mail, she said she didnt know and I should just resubmit the paperwork. I called back several times to look for my electronic payment and on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a very rude gentleman who also said he did not see the payment. He told me to email my bank statement to XXXX, which I later discovered was an invalid email address. On the same call, we contacted XXXX XXXX on a conference call and spoke with XXXX who advised that the payment was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and should have been received by Loancare by the time of the call. The gentleman said okay thank you and did not ask for a tracking number or anything. I interjected and asked XXXX for the tracking number and confirmation number so that I could have proof that the payment was sent to Loancare. She provided me with a confirmation # of XXXX and trace # XXXX. At that time, the gentleman told me I would be receiving my refund and nothing further was needed. Towards the end of the call, he read a note in his system that was posted at XXXX stating the payment would be rejected. The telephone call that I made to Loancare was at approximately XXXX XXXX and lasted over an hour. I asked him why he kept me on the pone for so long if there was already a note about my payment entered into the system. He ignored my question. I asked for a supervisor call back and never received it. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke with several representatives that could not help, but only offer a supervisor call back which I never received. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX XXXX. She works in loss mitigation and told me she did not see the payment and advised me that my loan had just gone to foreclosure. She went further to advise me that if I had called yesterday ( which was a Sunday ) they could have offered me an in-house payment plan. I explained to her that no one ever mentioned an in-house plan as a step before foreclosure, and that I should be able to take advantage of it since all of the representatives that I spoke with were clearly negligent by not educating me about my options. In the midst of that, I had already resubmitted my 2nd loss mitigation application and was waiting for further instructions. Ms XXXX advised that she would document the call, but that should could not help me with a payment arrangement. She transferred me to Collections where I demanded to speak with a supervisor. I spoke with a young lady who said my payment was sent back to me and gave me the confirmation and tracking number that was given to me by XXXX XXXX. I explained to her that the numbers she gave me were not for the return of the money, and that whoever input the note did it incorrectly as several reps had tried giving me that same number and telling me it was for my payment being sent back to me. After waiting on hold for quite a while, I was transferred to a supervisor named XXXX on the west coast, agent ID XXXX. He listened to my concerns with perceived compassion and assured me that he would research the payment. He also gave me the confirmation that was listed in the notes, but it was the same confirmation number that was given to me by XXXX XXXX. He said he would research and follow up. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a rep that was able to instant message XXXX on the west coast. She relayed a message from him saying that the cashiers department needed proof of payment in writing. At that point I had become furious because 6 days were wasted. I could have requested that while I had the XXXX XXXX representative on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX. I became IRATE and was placed in the manager queue. A manager answered the phone and as I began to yell out of frustration, he disconnected the call. I called back and was finally able to speak to a manager in Loss Mitigation named XXXX. At that point I was severely stressed and hypertensive and needed to ask my XXXX year old daughter to get out of the car and go into XXXX so she would not have to see me having a nervous breakdown. XXXX was able to calm me down and told me that I can be placed on a payment arrangement where I would pay half of the past due ( 5 months ) and the remaining amount would be split up over 5 or 6 payments. She said I would need to do this through the Collections Department. I thanked XXXX for caring and helping me and told her I would call Collections the next day. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Collections and asked for the payment plan and was told, very rudely, that XXXX was wrong. I explained that I was very frustrated with the handling of my situation by SEVERAL reps and that someone should be able to help me. The young lady came back to the phone and said her manager would make an exception and accept 4 payments by XX/XX/XXXX. I told her that I should be given what I was originally offered and she rudely told me we are making an exception for you because this is the first time this has happened. Her tone was rude and condescending so I asked for her manager. Unfortunately I was on my lunch break and could not hold because we have to punch in right at XXXX or face penalty points. I called back later that evening and demanded to speak with a Team Lead or manager in Loss Mitigation. I was able to reach XXXX who listened to me very attentively and agreed that XXXX was wrong, but said he would do what he could to help me. I told him I DO NOT WANT A MODIFICATION and I just needed time to get a lump sum together to get out of foreclosure. He gave me the email to request the reinstatement amount and suggested that I follow up with my bank for proof of payment of the {$1000.00} that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. Because XXXX was able to listen to my concerns, I asked if he would ask someone to research ALL of my calls and review the timeline of events in an effort to offer some kind of consideration or discretion since I feel that Loancare was very negligent in presenting me pertinent information that could help to save my house. XXXX said he would review everything. Because this situation has caused me a great amount of stress, I waited 9 days to call back. I called back today and spoke with XXXX in Loss Mitigation. She said she would have XXXX call me back with the status of his research. I have not heard anything as of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, the writing of this letter. My loan is 5 months past due and I currently have 2 and a half payments that I can send in, but I need to be assured that they will process towards payments. Loancare has also told me that they dont take payments when a loan is this far behind, but if you review my account, you will see that they have. Loancare has not even investigated my original Loss Mitigation packet that was mailed in on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed a copy of the receipt with tracking number that was sent to zip code XXXX and reported as received. I understand that the Loss Mitigation Packet was sent with the payment, but I find it very hard to believe that it is the companys policy to shred anything that is not a payment. I sent a complaint to Loancare several times between XXXX and now asking that they review EACH AND EVERY PHONE CALL so that corrective action can be taken immediately to help me save my home. Furthermore, I NEVER RECEIVED A BREACH LETTER FROM LOANCARE. I spoke with XXXX in Loss Mitigation on XX/XX/XXXX. He assured me that I was in good shape and that my account was being reviewed by the underwriter. After over a week without any communication from LoanCare, I called on Monday XX/XX/XXXX and was told by a representative that my Loss Mitigation Request was set up for trial payments in the amount of {$1000.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that I would receive documentation by XXXX or XXXX in the next few days. On Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX, I called LoanCare and was told that I was denied. This is yet another instance of LoanCare giving me incorrect information, furthering my distress with this matter. I called XXXX for clarification, he said he would reach out to the underwriter and get back to. As of the date of this letters update ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I have not heard from XXXX. My account has now gone 6 months past due, and this could have been prevented at the 4 month mark. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Loancare that had been forward y an attorneys office indicating the payoff amount for my loan. However, I requested a REINSTATEMENT amount back on XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, the payoff letter expired XX/XX/XXXX, but I did not receive it until XX/XX/XXXX. Also, when I got home that night, I received a letter from LoanCare address to me and XXXX XXXX regarding a pre-foreclosure sale. I called LoanCare and spoke with XXXX and asked if there was any information in my file that LoanCare had received my complaint. XXXX indicated that I could call XXXX and file a complaint. I called that number and left a voicemail. On Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX AFTER XXXX Eastern Time and the recording stated they were closed. The previous recording stated there hours were Monday through Friday XXXX to XXXX Eastern Time. I called Loancare and spoke with XXXX in Loss Mitigation who advised that I would get a supervisor call back the same day. I never received the call. LoanCare is NOT interested in me keeping my home, but only in taking it from me so they can profit. They have stalled, lied, miscommunicated and misrepresented information on NUMEROUS occasions throughout this ordeal which has caused me a significant amount of stress. I have called numerous times over the past 7 weeks and been given inaccurate information on numerous occasions. I have NEVER received a follow-up call from a supervisor and at this point need this situation ESCALATED to HIGH MANAGEMENT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS : LOANCARES REPRESENTATIVES FAILED TO INFORM ME DURING SEVERAL PHONE CALLS IN THE IN THE MONTH OF XX/XX/XXXX THAT I COULD DO AN IN-HOUSE REPAYMENT PLAN AND I WAS TOLD ON XX/XX/XXXX THAT I WAS ONE DAY LATE AND MY HOME WAS SENT TO FORECLOSURE. IT IS BECAUSE OF LOANCARES NEGLIGENCE THAT MY HOME IS IN FORECLOSURE. I AM REQUESTING ALL TELEPHONE CALLS BE PULLED AND INVESTIGATED TO PROVE THAT LOANCARE IS AT FAULT FOR MY LAON REACHING THIS LEVEL. I HAVE 5 PAYMENTS THAT I CAN SEND IN BUT THEY ARE REFUSING AND DECIDED TO PLACE MY HOME IN FORECLOSURE SO THAT THEY CAN PROFIT FROM IT. PLEASE REVIEW THIS INFORMATION THOUROUGHLY SO THOSE RESPONSIBLE CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND I CAN RESUME PAYMENTS ON MY MORTGAGE.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I was sent a debt forgiveness offer by XXXX XXXX XXXX via mail, I emailed the company to verify if the offer was still available, the offer was : To pay \" special offer balance '' of {$2000.00} and my account will be marked paid in full. The company confirmed that the offer was available and provided an address to send the check. I sent a check of {$2000.00} first, then {$26.00} totaling in {$2000.00} in XXXX of 2019. This was a cashiers check from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. After paying the balance I waited a month and the company did not update my credit report. I emailed them and they said they would contact Experian but nothing changed. I then filed a dispute with Experian by speaking with a representative over the phone, I also sent the letter that was sent by XXXX XXXX XXXX and a copy of the checks sent. Experian completed the dispute as \" remains the same ''. I called again, to find out why it was not updated. Experian Rep. explained that it can not be removed and my dispute was to have this item removed.

( Attached PDF - Reference 3 ) This property was subject of a foreclosure sale by Sale Committee on XX/XX/2019, although the report of the Committee has not been marked for judicial consideration ( potential approval ) until XX/XX/2019.

Such concurrent filings might be permitted for instances of abandoned or unoccupied residential buildings, however despite the repeated placement of \" XXXX - Vacant '' stickers on an accessory ( storage/garage ) building on the property, there seems to exist no other evidence or rationale to think that this single family home actively occupied by the mortgagor ( me ) had somehow become abandoned property.

      "VALUE OF S is I opened a checking and saving account with Citi bank on XX/XX/XXXX. I was trying to fund it with {$15000.00} to be eligible for a {$400.00} bonus as part of a promotion that was running at that time. However, I could not create an online account because I was not mailed a pin number that was required. I called Citi twice regarding this but never received my pin, and during the last call the representative suggested going to the branch to fund my account. Since I am working I could only go to the bank on the following weekend ( more than 30 days past opening ) and the employee at the bank funded my account and told me I would still be eligible for the bonus and he would put in a special note since it was not my fault I could not fund it sooner. I waited 90 days but never received the bonus. I contacted Citi via a help line and when they were unable to help, I went to my local branch where I was promised I was still eligible for a bonus. They opened a case ( XXXX ) for me and on XX/XX/XXXX I got a letter from Citi stating \" We have confirmed that your account has met the necessary requirements to qualify for Promotion XXXX. Please allow 90 days from the date of the qualifying transaction ( s ), which satisfied the terms and conditions, to receive your incentive. '' 90 days from the date of qualifying transactions should mean 90 days from when I funded the account which was XX/XX/XXXX. But when I called Citi again, they told me it would take another 90 days! So I waited another 90 days, for a total of over 6 months and have still not received my bonus. I have called citi again about not upholding what they stated in the letter, but rather than fixing the issue they opened another case ( # XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX and said it will be resolved and funded within 7-10 business days. So on XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to Citi via chat and they said they will contact their promotions department and I will hear back in 3 days. Citi has continually failed to resolve this issue and keeps opening cases and routing to various departments with no end in sight. It has been over 180 days from when I met the qualifications for the bonus. I have an official letter from Citi stating that I would get the bonus within 90 days, so I feel this is clearly a breach of contract. Deal with Citi representatives on phone calls, going to the physical branches multiple times, keeping track of various messages/letters/cases has been extremely time consuming and a very frustrating experience. It is also financially difficult having to deal with this and maintain {$15000.00} with Citi for such a long time without access when I was expecting this only to last for 90 days. In short, Citi has failed to follow through what it has promised in their official communications and I feel lied and cheated to, with no avenue for resolution directly with Citi. I am therefore reaching out to CFPB to help resolve this and hopefully prevent other consumers from having to deal with these fraudulent and misleading tactics.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is To whom it concerns, I would like to file a formal complaint against Citi Prepaid Services, regarding an outbound manual money transfer made on XX/XX/2016. The transfer was never delivered to my partners XXXX account with XXXX, and also was n't delivered to the intermediary bank, XXXX XXXX. We have been told by Citi Prepaid that the transfer left our account and should have been received on XX/XX/2016. Over a month ago Citi Prepaid informed us it was being elevated to their own personal investigations department and that we would hear from them regarding the status of our investigation. During this time frame we have heard nothing aside from that it is being investigated. We have been given zero updates with no regard for any questions we have risen concerning the status of this ongoing investigation. This is highly concerning as now we are worried that the money is lost or stolen and we have no support from Citi Prepaid Services in tracking the missing transfer. Their costumer services supervisor, XXXX, Informed us they can not give us a tracking number or any information, which seems unbelievable and suspicious. The effects of this situation go beyond just our missing money. My partner and I are damaging our credit ratings by the day, and due to a total lack of confidence in Citi Prepaid 's transfer system we are afraid to move more money into our personal accounts. I request that you respond to this compliant urgently. Yours Sincerely,\n",

Wells Fargo ACH system did not pick up the payments until several days after I had scheduled the payments, which caused my bank account to be overdrawn due to Wells Fargo 's delayed process for ACH payments.

I was in the process of executing the payment plan I had proposed when Wells Fargo had papers delivered compelling me to accept their mortgage modifications or face foreclosure. I have faxed their application and the proofs required to them. While I have a decent credit score, I have frozen my credit reports on all credit bureaus, so I would prefer not to allow any one time access of my credit report, considering I have the necessary income to make the payments according to the plan I have proposed. I intend to sue Wells Fargo if they do not properly accept the payment plan I proposed, considering it's not likely it would be an undue hardship for Wells Fargo to accept the payment plan.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Hi, I initially reported all of the fraud on my TransUnion credit report on identitytheft.gov, and according to the FTC 's instructions I sent TransUnion a letter indicating which debts were not mine, and that I was a victim of identity theft. I received a letter from TransUnion indicating that they will not investigate the identity theft and fix my credit report. I spoke to someone from the FTC and they said that under FCRA ( a ) \" Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. \" I literally fulfilled all of the 1-4, and even provided the FTC identity theft report. According to them in FCRA B, they rescinded to block the fraudulent information. Honestly, I don't know why they did this, and I didn't benefit from this fraudulent activity. My credit is ruined, and my home buying process is delayed due to this experience, and my credit cards have been affected by reducing my credit line. All of this experience has been horrible. Today I called TransUnion customer service due get clarification to this letter, and the agent advised me to get letters from each creditor, and send it to TransUnion. As of date, I have not received any letters from any of the creditors to fix my credit report, and as a private company all TransUnion does not follow FTC rules. Also, under FCRA 605 C, \" ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. '' Seriously, how could an identity theft victim receive any benefits? My credit report is wrecked, and TransUnion refuses to follow the law to recuperate my identity.\n",

I have been using this card ever since until XX/XX/XXXX when I called the bank and informed them I wanted the account closed and my deposit refunded. To my surprise the bank informed me that my card wasn't secured anymore and was operating as a normal credit card. US Bank claimed to have refunded me the money back in XX/XX/XXXX. I am adamant that no refunds were ever received from US Bank. I then requested documentary evidence or a paper trail that clearly shows a check from US Bank or funds were deposited in my account. The bank is unable to provide any evidence citing an obscure law that allowed them to destroy banking records after 7 years. They request that I take them at their word and they got no reason to lie to me. I find this very insulting. Its a brazen attack on my intelligence! I called the bank again today XX/XX/XXXX to no avail and spoke with XXXX in Underwriting. I also left a message for a manager called XXXX and she called me back stating her agreement with what previous employees had advised me. They stated my only other hope is to write a letter to their US Bank President or send fax. The President cant be reached by email or phone. Their goal is to make it harder for consumers like me to get their issues addressed\n",

I was awaiting letter in the mail all this time just to find out their system had an error. As you can see, I have always had a stellar payment record. I tried contacting Experian, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with no successful resolution. Experian, XXXX, and XXXX only reporting me 30 days late. There was an error on their part.

      "VALUE OF S is Ability Recovery Services contacted me by phone several times, the most recent being XX/XX/XXXX for a debt owed to XXXX University. As of XX/XX/XXXX this debt has been fully paid to XXXX University through their online portal payment system. As a result, the balance with the University has been satisfied and is no longer owed. I spoke with XXXX XXXX and another rep who identified herself as XXXX XXXX on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and XXXX. I notified the collector that I had made a payment with XXXX University via their online system in the amount of {$1600.00}. These payments were made on XX/XX/XXXX for {$300.00} and XX/XX/XXXX for {$1300.00} and covered the total debt I had with the University. The representative was very short with me and extremely rude. She hung up on me and denied me access to speak with a supervisor regarding my account. I inquired about the process for removing the account from credit report once the balance has been paid. The representative stated that the account will first report as paid in full and then two weeks later it will be removed from all three credit reports. I asked could I get a statement in writing confirming this and she noted that Ability Recovery Services would not be able to furnish a written statement. I have repeatedly asked to escalate mt concerns to a supervisor and the representative continued to say \" I am not going to go back and forth with you or transfer you ''. The representative has noted that unless I am calling to make a payment she will not speak to me. I also have reason to believe that the representative who identified herself as XXXX XXXX, lied about her name. Based on the voicemails I have received from \" XXXX '', her voice and accent sounds exactly the same.\n",

I have spoken with numbers representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how XXXX, XXXX and Experian verifies their public records. I want to know this information because the public record keeps coming back as mine. I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through eOscar. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. I advised that I would like to cancel that dispute and they advised that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact them with my name and the case number. Being that I work for a law firm, I know the court system and their procedures, but decided to call anyway. Contacted the court and they advised that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. I decided to call XXXX back, spoke with another rep this time and they advised that the information is verified by the runner who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus.

      "VALUE OF S is FIRST - none of the options that took me to this place fit my case. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a merchant services company who works with XXXX. My association with this service began XX/XX/XXXX with a 4 year lease on a credit card capture device through my bank in XXXX, Ohio, XXXX XXXX Bank. In XXXX of XXXX I had to close my business due to poor sales and moving from XXXX to XXXX where the sales market and distances to the better eastern markets were not good. As I closed my business I tried several times to contact XXXX to let them know that I wanted to return the machine XXXX. I only did five trade shows a year, I never owned a storefront, but the lease payment was monthly, per the lease contract. I could never get a human on the phone. Every phone call was answered with automation and the requirements were to submit my merchant ID number, phone number, house number, terminal ID, email address and if anywhere in that series a number didn't satisfy the input requirements the automated system would then recite to me to call back when I had all of the correct information. I had moved to XXXX by then and was trying to update my information and my bank account and to ask how to end the lease with the close of my business. Being unable to speak to a human being and my XXXX bank account closed ( no XXXX XXXX Bank in Colorado ), I stopped payment to XXXX. That got a human phone call. Before I could proceed at all with my case, I had to update my banking information, mailing/home address, phone number etcetera. I had to repeat this a few more times as I was passed on to other offices until I finally spoke with someone about all of the above circumstances. I was told that the lease contract was enforceable through XX/XX/XXXX and still had to pay for the lease of the machine and service whether or not I used it. I told them I wanted to return the machine so that it wouldn't be lost in the coming 12+ months of non-use. They mailed to me directions as to how to return the machine. I returned the machine on XX/XX/XXXX. I had professional help with my XXXX taxes and when I got the year back it was boxed and placed in storage. In XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, I noticed that XXXX was still drawing monthly lease payments from my XXXX XXXX bank account. I didn't pay much attention to the XXXX draw, not certain if it was tor the month of XX/XX/XXXX. But when they drew from my bank again in XXXX, I began trying to make phone calls to XXXX. As ever, it was maddening that I could not get past the robot technology. I had not changed any of my account information since XX/XX/XXXX but in XXXX of XXXX I could not get past that final order to try again when I had the correct information. These phone calls take a lot of time and are enfuriating. They have all my information and most of all my routing and bank account number. I went into storage and found my XXXX tax year and pulled the XXXX file and after more phone calls finally got a human answer. The woman was professional and polite and after making certain she had all of my merchant ID, bank routing and checking account numbers, phone number and address and email address, she then let me know that they have no record of receipt of the XXXX machine that I shipped back a year ago. Until I could provide proof of return I would have to continue payment on the lease or I could purchase the machine. It wasn't expensive, less than {$300.00} but the idea was frustrating. Not only had I just paid over {$600.00} for the past year lease for a machine that I no longer used nor had in my possession, but payment would not cease ever, unless I paid the purchase price for the device. I searched for proof of shipment but it was not in my tax records. Lost somehow, so I went to my post office and was told records don't go back that far. So the next step seemed logical, I had to pay for the machine. I found a paper from XXXX and tried them, since XXXX didn't like something in my numerical interview. On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and I got an XXXX woman agent who was very kind and patient but the phone connection was very bad. We both mentioned a few times that it was hard to hear and understand each other. In my rising anger at the unfairness of all this I found myself yelling over the phone that I had sent that machine back a year ago. I told her that I was advised a week before her that I could purchase the machine and that was what I wanted to do. She seemed sympathetic to my case and said she'd sent the case forward with priority, as an appeal for refund of money taken over the past year. That wasn't the reason for the call, but I did feel better at the possibility. A few days later I got a blunt email stating that the case was denied, that payment for services must be paid \" whether I used them or not. '' I tried to reply to the email, stating that I wanted to just pay for the machine and end all this but I got an automated email reply stating that the case was closed and no longer monitored. I got more than one email such as that one, stating in clear terms that nobody would talk to me about the case. It's worth mentioning that the emails that told me my case was denied do not indicate that no reply was possible so of course I spent a lot of time ( as I am, now XXXX trying to explain, only to get a \" reply '' that nobody was ever going to see nor reply to my case. Payment has been stopped, to XXXX but I expect a phone call from them, asking where their money is. They are the worst customer service anyone 's worst imagination could face. The complete disregard for myself as a business owner, a human and a professional are off the charts.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I obtained an Amazon Store Card through Synchrony Bank in XX/XX/XXXX. During that time we used the card to purchased high ticketed items during our renovations ( sinks, faucets etc.. ). Recently, we noticed a transaction charge for card security of {$120.00}. I did not know what this was. I called the number on my bill and i was informed that I needed to call the card security service directly. The number was provided on my statement. When i called card security, they were very receptive and explained to me that I have been charged for this service since XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that i was not aware of the service and that I did not sign up for the service. I also asked how this was presented during the application process and if it was represented clearly, i would not have agreed to it. The representative immediately reversed the charges going back to XX/XX/XXXXand it was a little over {$2000.00} credited within a week. She provided me with a case number of XXXX. I realized that since XX/XX/XXXX i have been paying finance charges to Synchrony Bank for the charges from card security. I contacted Synchrony Bank and explained the situation. I spoke to two representatives who did not understand the over all situation. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been charged financed charges of 27.99 % for this transaction. I explained that this should be reversed. I also explained that I do not challenge the interest rate, but I challenge the finance charged on this transaction that should not have been charged to begin with. Operator # XXXX ( XXXX ) could only credit me back 2 months of interest rate charges. I explained to her that i have been charged more. Unfortunately she was not able to calculate the errors nor was she willing to go back and investigate. I clearly explained that their third party vendor made an error and already processed a credit resolution but since they are the creditor, they should be able to go back and investigate the error.\n",

Now they have called me on my cell phone and sent me a notice, again offered a \" reduced balance amount. '' Convergent XXXX clearly does not honor reduced balance offers. They must rely on the fact that the balance was paid so long ago that I do not have document to prove what I paid and the notice they sent.\n",

I called 6 different phone numbers for Experian and was routed into the same automated messaging system each time. I tried using their website to unfreeze my account. I entered all of my information and hit submit only to get a response back that states \" We are unable to process your request '' and \" If you need further assistance please call XXXX.

XXXX had so many modification applications at the time they had outsourced some of their work. Anyway they mislabeled my loan lost my loan application and this continued for a couple of years. Instead of a modification they started foreclosure proceedings. I ended up filing bankruptcy. My mortgage was included. Then after a few years of paying my bankruptcy payments XXXX wanted the amount increased. I was paying XXXX a month they wanted XXXX a month I could not pay that amount so my case was dismissed. I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX to get this done. We called several times a month before the bankruptcy and after the bankruptcy was dismissed. They finally came back with XXXX left on my principal balance and were supposed to be doing a modification. In the meantime I received a letter from Shellpoint mortgage saying they were servicing my loan and it was XXXX. We called XXXX and they told us that my loan had not been sold or transferred and that they were still working on a modification. Well it had been sold and Shellpoint had started foreclosure proceedings. I called them and told them what happened and I contacted my attorney to file bankruptcy again. But they stopped the foreclosure and agreed to do a modification. I did the trial period and the paperwork came back with my principal balance being XXXX. I disputed the amount of my principal balance. They told me if I didnt sign the modification that I would immediately go into foreclosure. I said I would sign the paperwork to avoid foreclosure but I disputed the charges. I contacted the Alabama attorney generals office for help. Shellpoint told them that the charges were from the missed payments from when XXXX had my loan. I explained to Shellpoint that XXXX agreed that all I owed was XXXX and they were supposed to do the modification which Shellpoint was fully aware of anyway. My first paper statement from Shellpoint reflects my principal balance being XXXX. They still refuse to remove the charges of over XXXX making what I owe more than my original loan and have sold my mortgage to XXXX mortgage servicing. Also when I called Shellpoint to tell them that making the payments on the first of the month might be a problem their agent told me that Shellpoint doesnt consider a payment late if its made in the month its due. They sent me a nasty letter threatening foreclosure even though I was never behind and added late payment fees to every payment. But that didnt happen until I sent them messages requesting the other fraudulent charges be removed.\n",

I spoke with XXXX on the phone and filed the dispute, however, Bank of America is holding my temporary credit in the amount of {$100.00}, stating that since I had other claims in the past, they are not going to credit my account on the regular timing until they finalize the investigation, that could take up to 60 days, instead of 2 days. I spoke with several representatives since XX/XX/XXXX which includes XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) and on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, but nothing has been resolved and every time I call and a note is put on my account by a representative, the situation is becoming harder to resolve. I asked several times to speak to a manager about this situation, but all the representatives above have refused to transfer me to a manager. Yesterday when I spoke with Bank of America, I was asked to wait until today to have the transaction completely posted, since the transaction was still processing and I would receive a temporary credit for that dispute once it completed or dropped out of my account. Today the transaction is showing posted and I was advised by all the representatives I spoke with and XXXX XXXX that Bank of America is going to hold my temporary credit due to other disputes I filed in the past. I also spoke with XXXX in customer services, but she started to display some angry behavior on the phone as we started to talk, so I thanked her and ended my conversation with her immediately. Bank of America is disregarding that the {$100.00} fuel charge posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX is a fraudulent transaction and not a merchant dispute and needs to be handled seriously and on a timely manner, since my funds are being held on the fraudulent transaction. I have been treated by Bank of America representatives with disrespect and unwillingness to resolve my issue.\n",

While I eventually paid the full balance due, the closed account was continuously late from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This account continues to show up on all three credit bureau reports. Because the date of first default is more than seven years ago and the account was in collections, the entire account should by now be removed from my credit report. I filed a dispute with TransUnion and received notification that XXXX XXXX XXXX had confirmed the account as accurate and is reporting it as late from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. It does not show the earlier late payments. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX 's Credit Card Department. The employee informed me that he also saw that the account should be removed from my credit report but transferred me to the Collections Department for further assistance. The Collections Department Employee told me that they do not keep records going back that far and was unable to locate my old account for further assistance.\n",

My account was only due a charge of {$35.00} or {$70.00} when I learned that I had an overdraft balance. I contacted the bank regarding this ruling asking for a reversal of this amount because I was not aware of this change. There were never any signs posted, nothing in the newspapers, etc that these accelerated charges were about to happen. Since most of the time, I used internet banking, nothing was listed to refer me to this change in policy. Also, there was no information regarding this change at the teller windows. It was almost as if it was hidden since I had opted for statements on line. During the same time I was complaining the television stations carried the story of the upset customers and claims were made to the XXXX controller and Senator XXXX XXXX 's office. TCF still did not reverse these fees. I would have never agreed these fees or services. I was required to pay this {$500.00} before I could close this account. I am requesting a reimbursement of my fees that I paid for this change in policy that was unfair to me in accordance to the recent ruling.\n",

I followed all the requirement of outlined on the email of XXXX and yet I did not receive the {$1000.00} cash back bonus by XX/XX/XXXX as promised on that email. I have called them several times on this issues, despite the fact that they confirm my qualifications for the cash back bonus, yet they say it would take 7-10 business day to do research on the reason why you have not been paid. Exh. 2 is a chat print of an ally agent with me on XX/XX/XXXX in which it is stated that I have been qualified for the cash back bonus and that it would take 7-10 business day to get the money. However, this sounds to me fishy as to why it should take 7-10 business day to deposit the money into my account while it was supposed to be done by XX/XX/XXXX. I ask them to pay the bonus and then do your research about your software problem. They are not listening and bushing me around.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I check my credit weekly and today XX/XX/19 I noticed that my credit score for all three Credit Reporting Agencies had DROPPED approx. 50 POINTS from the previous week. There was NO DEROGERTY Information since the previous week. As a matter of fact all the information change was POSITIVE. XXXX, XXXX and Experian were all similar results. Additionally, I have never been late on anything ... I called XXXX and Experian and in both cases the customer service representative was NOT ABLE to make any sense of the issue. The gross and incorrect misrepresentation of my credit is a detriment to me in many ways. My occupation, My credit and other things as well. The bottom line is ; The credit reporting agencies are not accountable to anyone. Individuals harmed by these agencies can rarely recover anything, and there is nothing that can be done to correct information regardless of weather it is correct, incorrect, inaccurate unless they want to.. XXXX, XXXX and Experian appear not to care ... ...\n",

My auto payment ( contractually agreed upon at time of leasing in XX/XX/XXXX ) was increased by {$3.00} per month with no reason given by Ally some time in XX/XX/XXXX. I was never informed. Months later, once it accumulated to {$27.00}, I began receiving calls incessantly from Ally and did understand why. I finally spoke to a representative and they explained that my account was delinquent and past due {$27.00} which would be reported to the credit bureau and adversely impact my credit if I did not pay right away. I was furious as I pay {$280.00} automatically on time every month. I asked the Ally representative to simply take the payment over the phone and they told me I could not. I asked them to just take it out of my auto payment ... they told me they could not. I asked them to push balance month to month so that the additional charge would be paid in my lats auto payment. They said they could not do that. They told me to go online and log in and change my auto payment. I have tried SEVERAL times and can not do this online. I finally gave up and made a manual payment online on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$27.00} in addition to my auto payment. Since I can not log on monthly to pay {$3.00} so that my account is not delinquent, I am collecting a late fee of {$4.00} every month in addition. I am certain I am not the only one they are running this scheme on ... What they are doing this is making it inconvenient for me to pay an arbitrary, nominal increase to my loan which results in a late fee. They are making {$7.00} off of me monthly and I have no control. They are counting on me to not log on every month to pay {$3.00}. I don't know how this practice is legal.

XXXX removed the alert immediately upon me contacting them to do so. When I called Experian to have it removed I asked why was a fraud alert placed on my report without my authorization. They claim because XXXX was reporting they would do the same. I explained to them that XXXX already removed the alert and that they should please do the same. That was on XX/XX/XXXX. I mentioned how imperative that they so because I have a closing on my new primary residence on XX/XX/XXXX. The man that took my information said that I answered the security questions incorrectly and that I would have to upload proof of identification. This is after I already proved my identity with ss # DOB, Current address, and previous address and employer and phone #. As you can imagine I became very irate and demanded that this alert be removed from my credit report. I then complied on XX/XX/XXXX with a letter and copy of my driver 's license and uploaded to their website. The information was received by then on that date. I called back today to inquire about and get an update on my status since my lender has informed me that this is the only thing keeping me from getting my clear to close. So explained that to the person who answered my call today and to please remove this fraud alert. I called in today and explained this to them that this was happening and I was hung up on 4X '' s. This is unacceptable and when I finally was able to speak to someone the man I spoke with said that they still did not receive my documents needed to remove the alert. As you can imagine I lost my cool and explained how this could possibly be. I really feel that they are playing games with me and making a mockery of me because I called out a few of there employees on how unprofessional they were.

They have indicated that they \" researched '' the account and found the reporting to be accurate. This can not be possible as I was forced to wait in their XXXX XXXX XXXX location most of the day while the loan was audited and found to be current. The issue occurred when they added insurance to my account without informing me. I walked into the branch every month and made my payment. Not once did any associate tell me I was behind on my account until I received a one month late notice. I was confused but brought it current. They continued to carry the insurance fee over until my payment was one month late. When I questioned them, they would not give me information. When I finally got to the information I needed, I corrected the insurance issue. They chose to apply the insurance credit to principle and refused to bring my loan current. I went to the primary branch and remained in the lobby until a representative finally put the loan in for audit. The audit revealed that the loan was not behind. That representative told me he would not correct the reporting. I have been disputing it since then. If the audit revealed the loan to be current. The reporting should have been corrected also. There is no logic to support that an incorrect loan that required auditing and correction was reported accurately as it was.\n",

At around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, ( 4 hours after this search started ), I received a call from B of A ( XXXX XXXX (? ) saying the debit was for an amount of money B of A had written off years ago. This representative was very sketchy on details and made many erroneous statements ( like arguing that the money was taken from my checking account and not my savings ) trying to justify this debit to my account. I inquired why I had not been contacted. He replied I would be receiving a letter from B of A soon. It is now 5 days and I have seen so such letter.

To add insult to injury, the B of A representative said they left the {$500.00} in the account to save me the service fee that would be charged if the account fell below {$500.00} Thanks a lot, BANK OF AMERICA.

I still don't know my loan number, I have not seen my billing statement, and I have not seen the due date at all. It is not right for XXXX to file such claim to damage my credit, given I had 28 years of excellent credit history with no late or missed payment and my credit score was XXXX. Now it dropped to XXXX because of XXXX XXXX false claim. In addition, credit bureau does not inform me when they dropped my score drastically for a single late payment that was not even my fault.

I was considered not paid while my credit card was on file for deduction and they did not charge me for that. And while asking XXXX XXXX XXXX through whom I was paying my Insurance bill with has informed me that all charges were settled out. With ignoring all those facts about me reaching out to resolve any standing issue, XXXX is just out of their way for collecting blindly without any details of what charges they are unpaid for.

This has caused a repossession and late bills and the bank is not doing anything whatsoever to resolve the matter I've banked with Navy Federal for 5 years and they have lost a customer. Claims were for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The compromise department called to inform me of the hacking and locked my account completely, i went to withdrawal funds and the withdrawal was declined. the funds that were put into the account and reversed back out no money was used besides the OOPS overdraft coverage.

In fact, I just learned that they again submitted the fraudulent account they created to collections. As stated in complaint XXXX, XXXX 's tricked me into opening a second XXXX 's account. I had a XXXX 's account for many, many years. They pretended to need to update information so that I could get a coupon for immediate use at the checkout desk. What they really did was open a second XXXX 's account. They then sent this secondary account to collection which DECIMATED MY ALMOST PERFECT CREDIT RATING. After promising to remove the incorrect information from the credit bureaus, they have now AGAIN SUBMITTED TO COLLECTIONS THIS SECONDARY ACCOUNT THEY FRAUDULENTLY OPENED.

The address in which i applied as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NV XXXX on XX/XX/2017 The clerk told me if I made on time payments and paid more than my minimum I should be approved within a year or less. I've called for an upgrade to a credit line a few times & I am given 3 reasons which I dont agree with, 1 being other deliquent accounts which was never explained to me. My credit wasnt good to begin with which is why I went with a secured card to Build my credit. Ive never received any paperworks proving that there has been a deny on a credit line or reason why. I now have 3 other credit cards which are not secure and I dont understand why my card can not be upgraded. I was given false information from this branch, made on time payments, always paid more than my minimum havent went over my limit which was told I would need to do to upgrade. And now i cant upgrade because i have deliquent accounts which are unrelated to Well Fargo overall. This is my oldest account and it will hurt my credit to close. This is not right and they lied to take a deposit for an account that will stay secured forever and may never be upgraded according to the bank now.\n",

The amount outstanding would be deducted from the balance as well as a {$40.00} service fee, and finally AFTER their deductions a 20 % Federal income tax fee would be calculated from the net amount. The loan had already been paid in full, so this was a flat-out LIE. Since this time I have observed the account still having a balance of {$300.00}. So I called them to have the remaining {$300.00} sent to me.

      "VALUE OF S is Dear Sir/Ma'am, Good afternoon! I bought a mattress from XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, VA in XX/XX/XXXX and used financing through Wells Fargo to pay it off in installments. Shortly after that, military obligations caused me to move to XXXX XXXX, CA. I had trouble getting auto payments set up after getting calls and calling Wells Fargo several times. I would get calls that the payment was due, I would pay it, and then ask why auto pay was not taking out the payments. After a few months of this happening, I then ended up deploying. When I returned the account had gone to collections and also been charged off. I received no emails about any of this happening. I then settled the entire account balance with Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX. My credit score had been increasing, due to no other negative remarks, and so I decided to send Wells Fargo a letter asking for a possible goodwill adjustment. The request was declined, but then I noticed that I had taken another big hit to my credit score. When I looked, Wells Fargo had updated the date reported on my account to XX/XX/XXXX. I'm not sure if they have the right to do this, but it seems unfair that an old debt could come back and negatively affect me well after it's been paid off and settled. I would just like some clarification as Wells Fargo has been unwilling to help me or give me answers. Thank you very much! Regards, XXXX XXXX\n",

I told the employee that I want to use my GAP credit card and I do not have my card, so she can look me up and use my rewards too- that is what I do when I do not have my card on me. She asked me if my card has a chip, and I replied that I do not recall. She told me that I can request a card with a chip and I will get promotional discounts. It seemed fair and I was happy. She had me enter my SS, which I always do if I do not have my card, and after a few minutes, she handed me my receipt and told me that I got all the discounts and I will get my card in the mail soon. I have received an OLD NAVY credit card!!!!! I never wanted to open a card with the store. I already have my GAP card, why would I open another store credit card? My credit score has been affected by opening that card while I was trying to work on my credit to get a new job. I called the company ( OLD NAVY ) and explained the situation and the representative was very nonchalant and did not show any sympathy towards my case.

      "VALUE OF S is This issue is with my credit card with Best Buy store card. In the month of XX/XX/2019 my credit card statement showed online unauthorized charges, so I immediately contacted Best Buy customer services and was transferred to the fraud department and reported the unauthorized charges totaling {$5600.00} with a previous balance of {$0.00}. I was told an investigation would take place. In XXXX I received a letter stating that the investigation was completed and that there was no evidence of fraud and I would be responsible for the purchases. I then contacted Best Buy Fraud department and questioned what the reason was for that showed that I was responsible. I was told that the notes were not specified clearly, so they gave me the option of having a second request for an investigation. In XXXX I received the conclusion of the second investigation. The letter and stated that they had completed their investigation and still find myself responsible. The letter did not have an explanation all they provided was the orders that showed an email that was used that was not mine and also a phone number that is not mine with the order delivered to a store in the city of XXXX XXXX, Ca. I notified Best Buy again and I was told by the Fraud department that I was responsible because of the purchases were delivered to my home. That is a huge contradictory when their paperwork shows a screenshot of the order was delivered to a store. I asked Best Buy to pull their video cameras and I was told they could not do that. In my opinion that would be an option to prove that I did not place these purchases nor picked them up. What is the purpose of video cameras if they refuse to use them to protect them and the consumers. After getting no resolution from Best Buy and notified XXXX, Ca Sheriffs Department and made a police report. When the officer that took my report contacted Best Buy himself they told him they refuse to deal with the Police Department because they are not authorized on the account. I find that completely wrong! I feel my rights as a consumer have been violated by Best Buy Franchise and I have written numerous letters to the Corporate office and have had nothing back from them. I have to continuously pay this bill that I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR so my credit isn't compromised. I am asking for help from the CFPB to exercise my rights as a consumer for fraud charges that Best Buy will not remove from my account. I should not be responsible for charges that I did not authorize nor received. The police report number for this dispute is XXXX from XXXX, Ca Sherriffs Department.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is After reviewing the financial history of account, below are the items I believe are in inaccurate and would like to formally dispute. XX/XX/XXXX a bill/due date in the amount of {$990.00} that differs from the principal but without detailed, itemized expenses. XX/XX/XXXX late charge of {$30.00} that should not have been assessed. XX/XX/XXXX a final payment of {$240.00} was made which was the amount that a XXXX representative stated was the remaining amount due. According to the payment history sent by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, there is a balance of {$16.00} that was remaining but there is no bill/due date noted that shows at any time any representative of XXXX either by mail or telephonically informed me of the {$16.00} balance. XX/XX/XXXX notes that the account was noted as a Charge Off even though the loan had been completely paid off via the amount XXXX stated on XX/XX/XXXX and I was never notified of a remaining balance of {$16.00}. XX/XX/XXXX notes an additional repossession expense charge off in the amount of {$400.00} that should not have been assessed as it was previously paid and again not in the stated pay off amount, via XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX late charge off fees of {$120.00} that should not have been assessed. XX/XX/XXXX non sufficient funds fee/charge off fees of {$25.00} that should not have been assessed. XX/XX/XXXX interest fees/charge off of {$.00} that should not have been assessed. In addition, the amounts paid on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX equates to a total of {$1000.00} which is greater than the final bill/due date that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and stated a final payment of {$990.00}. This was the last bill/payment request that XXXX XXXX mailed to me. On or around XX/XX/XXXX the paid off vehicle that this loan was secured on was traded in to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, VA. Legal ownership of the vehicle then transferred. The XX/XX/XXXX payment in the amount of {$560.00} should not be represented on my financial history account as the final payment as made on XX/XX/XXXX, the vehicle was sold to the dealership on or around XX/XX/XXXX, thus I was no longer the legal owner or in possession of the vehicle on XX/XX/XXXX. This payment activity transpired 9 months after legal ownership had transferred.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is There is an issues with incorrect information on credit reports, but one or two incorrect information is one thing, but when there is a list of incorrect information on credit reports that can only be attributed to either really incompetent data entering from credit bureaus or the credit organization reporting to the credit bureaus, which in this case I believe is both, there is something to be said. I tried to look at my credit reports and there is so many incorrect information on them, and when I tried to request my credit report online, then the credit bureaus would not let me access my reports and even show my information incorrectly, and when I tried to correct some of the information, they would not let me correct it, and when I enter my information correctly into their system, they display incorrect information right after I enter it correctly. I hate to say there is something going on that is very wrong here but it seems to me it is bad enough when the credit card companies are taking advantage of customer, but when the credit bureau who should be protecting the consumers no longer do their job or even goes as far as adding on the mistakes of incorrect records, consumers have little to do and maybe if that is the case, the credit agencies who are incorrect and not doing their job in the first place should not have a job.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Let me first say that I spoke with The collection agency, and I was very displeased with the outcome of what was discussed. It is truly very unethical to continue to pursue an amount after the information I have and I feel I should have not been Liable for the amount of {$120.00}. Collection Company : AmSher WebSite : https : //URL Debt Collector : XXXX Outcome : Pay {$95.00} in 1 month No real details were ever provided to me about how the charges on my credit report ended up becoming a debt collection. ( Very unprofessional in my opinion ) I never received any formal notice about this debt from the bank. Without giving my personal information I will explain what I told the collection agency. I became aware of the negative mark against my credit report for the first time on XX/XX/2019 and I contacted the collection agency AmSher. This is my first mark on my credit report. I have a 0 Fico score. I was told that the debt originated from XXXX. I was told that my Ssn and my name where used to create an account on XXXX, I asked for details of this and was informed of an Address tied to the account, at first the address did not register to me during the first call so I stated it was not associated with me. Also I was told to go ahead and contact the financial institution where the claim originated to see if by chance the amount could be striken and cleared before the collection process began. She is a debt collector working for a collections agency, why would she suggest this false option knowing that once a bank closes an account it is then left up to her agency to obtain a resolution. Again I would like to point out that ( no details of any real information was provided except an address of an XXXX XXXX XXXX ) located in XXXX county GA, my Ssn and my name. The address was that of a XXXX in which I was previously XXXX at for a long period of time. I These are important details that I need for my records. This is a claim from 4 Years ago. There needs to be some sort of detailed information report provided to me so I can substantiate this claim for myself. My credit status is very important to me regarding this. I proceeded to call the bank. I was told that since the account was closed nothing could be done on their end but that the collection should be nulled by providing the circumstances I told the bank. I asked for information from the bank and nothing was provided. I call AmSher back and got back in touch with representative XXXX to continue the collection. I informed her that the reason I was unable to pay the balance was due to me being XXXX for at least a period of 6 months with no form of assistance. The same year I suffered a very hard loss in my family. My mother XXXX from XXXX one month prior to my XXXX. I informed XXXX that I had no means to pay. I was in XXXX, I was young and I did not understand the importance of a negative balance and how it could affect me in the future. These are details I shared with her because I felt that she wanted to help me by avoiding a payment. After I was finished talking She informed me the best she could do was to lower the {$120.00} down to {$95.00} but I was only going to be given one month to provide the money. I felt I could not argue any further and accepted the offer. She gave me her information, Told me that when I had the payment ready I could contact her to settle this. I was only being allowed one month. The conversation ended. My complaint : I was over charged for a good or service or I over drafted my account is what happened to my best knowledge. ( No information for me to confirm ) so I really don't know. I was in a XXXX XXXX and did not have assitance. I had no means of contacting my bank. No means to inform them of my situation. The very least I expected was to have most if not all of the amount due stricken because circumstance in this situation matters. If I was aware and able the amount would have never been able to reach that high. This is completely my fault I was the one who committed a crime and XXXX. For your company to seek payment for almost 4 years. This is a shame and in the worst way wrong. The reason I am taking this action is because I feel I have been taken advantage of and treated unfairly by the collection agency. If I had been informed of this and able to reach out to the bank, I would have told them the circumstances and I'm almost certain XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would have not persued this. Thanks\n",

Earlier this evening an XXXX Customer Service Rep said that if I give the bank this Transaction ID # XXXX, that the bank will release the holding of my funds. That did not happen. The bank says there is nothing they can do to release my access to my funds! This has been a very difficult & unfair situation for me, the consumer! No where in the bank card info does it state a preauthorization hold on funds will take place, except in the case of a resteraunt tip, or for gas purchase. I feel this is a fraudulant charge to my account which there should be no reason to \" borrow '' my funds! This should be illegal. It is certainly a misrepresentation of the debit card issuer to deny me the use of my purchased funds! Or is it the Vendor, XXXX \" borrowing '' my money? Neither party will take responsibility.

      "VALUE OF S is In XX/XX/2018, I closed an XXXX XXXX Account. I had been dealing with several issues of identity theft, related to my ex-husband 's theft of my credit cards and personal information. The bills for this card were not going to my address as a result of this. When I was alerted to the debt, I attempted to get the debt consolidated with XXXX XXXX XXXX, an organization I had been working with to pay off the debts accrued by my ex husband, in an effort to repair my credit. XXXX XXXX made it very difficult to consolidate under this program, even though I was able to do this easily with my bank, which had recommended the program as a legitimate non-profit debt consolidation ( not forgiveness ) program. I spoke to an XXXX representative and explained the situation to the individual on the phone, stating that I would pay off the debt in full, but that I wanted adverse information about the debt off my credit report, as I had not acquired the debt, nor had I received any indication the debt had been accrued, since the bills were not sent to my address. I agreed to a lump sum payoff under the understanding that this adverse information would be removed from my credit report. The cost was substantial to me, around {$10000.00}, but it was worth the price of fixing my credit and moving on from the debts accrued in my name. I was under the impression the individual I spoke with on the phone agreed to these terms. However, several months later, the adverse information is still on my credit report and, in fact, until last month, XXXX XXXX was still reflecting that I had not paid the debt, though I had done so more than a year earlier. I am very distressed by this situation, as the identity theft has severely impacted my credit score and made it nearly impossible to move on from my divorce and find a new home for myself and my children. I would like this issue resolved, and for further advice on how to remove other negative items on my report that have been the result of identity theft.\n",

They have hurt my credit while I was building it up. I don't understand how anyone can just open these fraudulent accounts and hurt someone's credit like this. Something needs to be done to hold companies like this accountable with fines and prison time. This is just wrong and I feel bad for people who don't know their rights or how to handle situations like this.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My Paypal Credit account went past due in or around XXXX or XXXX of this year. After receiving multiple calls. I received a message that my account would be sent to collections. I do not know if this was an in-house collections or if it was sent to another company, I didn't keep track because I assumed they would honor their agreements. I returned the call where I was offered a payment agreement that stated in exchange for me scheduling my next three payments of {$270.00} with them over the phone I would be allowed to continue use of my account during the three months the payments were made even if my account showed past due, I would no longer receive collections calls, my account would not be reported to as past due to credit bureaus and my account would be reset/re-aged at the end of the three payments. The first two payments completed successfully and I was able to continue use of my account during those two months. Sometime after the second payment I started receiving collections calls again, roughly about XXXX of this year. I returned their call at XXXX and explained that I had a payment agreement and was told that servicing of Paypal Credit changed companies and that they didn't have all payment agreement information, they were investigating due to multiple calls, and that they would honor the previous agreement and my account would be re-aged 48 hours after my last scheduled payment in the agreement. Soon after my payment posted but the account was never re-aged. I called again and was told they misspoke, the department that does that is not open on the weekends and it would be reset after 48 business hours. I called again after this period of time and was told again they must have misspoke, I needed to call a second number because they set up the agreement. I called that number twice and both times I was transferred 2 to 3 times before finally being transferred to a number where I received a recording that stated this number was no longer in service. I called XXXX again and was told that they would set up a complaint for investigation. I finally called back today and was told my payment agreement never existed and they will not be re-aging my account. I would like to point out that now my account shows three months past due rather than the original one or two and my account is still in past due status. Exactly why would I set up a payment agreement that despite making payments every month allowed my account to fall further past due than it originally was? Now they want me to pay an over {$800.00} minimum payment to bring my account current which should not be the case, I can not afford, and if I could afford it my account would have never went into a past due status to begin with and they are now refusing to assist. Additionally, I believe that the original collections call, either in - house or with a different company, may have even recorded the conversation with me.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I, as well as my neighbors, have had multiple credit cards stolen from the mail. Most credit card companies, upon being notified, have immediately canceled the card and refunded the fraudulent charges. Bank of America, on the other hand, has refused to cancel the charges, claiming since the card was physically present, I am responsible. My Bank of America credit card had never been used in the previous 5 years, and yet, upon being used for a number of charges, no fraud alert or notification was sent to me. I personally noticed the charges when I was billed, and immediately notified Bank of America. During Bank of America 's investigation they noticed there was another phone number on my account, but they could not identify where that phone number came from. Was it used to activate the stolen card, or did someone else have access to my account? The only thing they claimed was since the card was physically present ( obviously, since it was stolen ), I was liable for those charges, which was a total of {$53.00}. As far as I can tell, Bank of America is unable to adequately protect its clients accounts and also unable to adequately investigate fraudulent charges. I have since closed my account, but am looking to get those fraudulent charges dismissed. My credit report shows that I normally have thousands of dollars of revolving debt every month, all of which is paid on time. However, I refuse to pay even {$50.00} for charges I did not make.\n",

Wells Fargo has not provided any reference numbers for me to track down this money or determine how to find the money. According to 12 CFR 1026.11 ( a ) ( 2 ) - ( 3 ), the bank is required to refund a negative balance within 7 days of my request, and only by \" cash, check, or money order, or credit to a deposit account of the consumer ''.

      "VALUE OF S is Hello. I've been a customer of Wells Fargo for about five years in DC. Recently when I called the automated line they asked me to say my name in order to record it and use it for identification/security purposes. I don't feel comfortable with that because I don't think it's respectful of privacy and I didn't. They put me through to a customer service agent on that call. About a month later I called again and this time their automated system would not put me through without me saying my name. This was never asked of me in the past five years. I managed to get through anyway by pressing zero about ten times and made a complaint to them about requiring my name to be said and about trying to get and use my bio-identity without my permission. I called them again recently to return the call of their rep who had left me a voicemail. I had deleted the vm by mistake and forgot the caller 's name and this time they required me to say my name before they would look at my account or before they would speak with me. I refused and asked to speak with a supervisor and the supervisor also refused to speak with me without me saying my name. She then tried to get me to say my name in a sneaky way, by saying she needs me to say it in order to continue speaking with me and when I asked her if it was for bio-identity purposes she denied it but she would not settle for me spelling my name. She also engaged in other mildly sneaky or disengenous behavior I feel. I am going to close my account because this is a dealbreaker at this point but I find it hard to believe that this kind of behavior is legal. I would hope that you will prosecute them if it's not legal behavior. Would you please inform me whether what they are doing is legal or not? Thankyou very much, XXXX XXXX\n",

Any additional money paid to the credit card would get applied first to the cash advance and then to the purchases. # 3 the agent mentioned I should transfer the cash advance balance to a 0 % interest card to get that paid off if it was fee-sable.

I'm not satisfied since I did what there rep told me to do to try to clean this up. Upon speaking directly with our credit card department, they stated the following : When payments are made over the minimum, the remainder will be applied to the balance with the highest interest baring balance. If 2 balances are at the same APR, we split the payment between the 2. There are numerous outstanding purchases on this card. Purchases and Cash Advances ( or expired balance transfers ) are at the same rate, therefore the system split the payment between the 2.

      "VALUE OF S is TransUnion continues to report information that resulted from ID theft on my credit report. They violated FCRA 605B several times, Never give me a reason for their decisions, and hide behind \" its our policy ''. If something does not meet their requirements, they are required by law to tell me that and tell me exactly what was missing or incorrect. I just got off the phone with XXXX XXXX, a representative from the specialized fraud department. She admitted the court does not report bankruptcy information to them, they use a third party vendor to obtain the information, which for information obtained before XX/XX/XXXX, would be XXXX. XXXX does not have a bankruptcy on file. So the court does not and did not report this to them, the vendor does not have a record of the bankruptcy in their records, PACER.GOV does not verify or report information to credit bureaus. My last dispute was opened on XX/XX/XXXX and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX claimed the court verified that dispute. Putting aside the fact that the court does not verify any information for credit bureaus, logistically, that is not possible. The court does not used Metro2 software and has no method of electronically receiving a dispute, investigating it and electronically sending it back. The dispute would have to be mailed out and it is not possible to mail something out and receive it back the next day, Even if they miraculously got metro2 / XXXX XXXX just to verify that 1 dispute, it still would not be possible because they are required to conduct a reasonable investigation and they would not be able to do that over night, while they are closed. The result reads '' we verified the information is accurate '', if the dispute was sent out to be investigated by the court or any other company, the result would specify that and would read \" the company that reported the information certified to us that it is accurate. '' I asked XXXX XXXX if it was marked as frivolous or duplicate dispute, she responded with \" it was closed on XX/XX/XXXX sir '' completely dodging the question, I asked her again and she said \" I dont see that '' which is another dodge. Her ability to see it wasnt in question. They refuse to help, and only offer to dispute the information. If I knew for fact they were going to do a proper dispute and investigation, I would have no issues having it disputed, even though by law they are required the block the information, since simply verify ID information does not solve ID theft. ID theft by nature has matching ID information, thats what makes it ID theft. XXXX XXXX said that FCRA requires them to only dispute and FCRA does not allow them to remove items. I was blown away by the amount of false/ inaccurate information a representative from the SPECIALIZED FRAUD department was giving me. Its disgusting that TransUnion is allowed to operate like this, with little to no repercussions. . This bankruptcy resulted from identity theft, I did not file it nor hire an attorney to file it for me. It is fraudulent so checking the information on PACER.GOV does not verify that it belongs to me. It provides no new information. It was already known that there was a bankruptcy filed with my information, that is why it is on my credit report. I've contacted PACER and they confirmed that they do not verify the accuracy of information to credit bureaus and although PACER is associated with the court, PACER itself is not a court. The court clerk also confirmed that the court does not verify information to credit bureaus and credit bureaus. The accuracy of information on the public record was not what was being disputed, the entire public record is being disputed. The spelling of my name and/or social security number is not the issue, I did not claim this bankruptcy was misrouted to my credit report or it belongs to someone else with a similar name. The bankruptcy was filed using my information without my authorization or knowledge. The identity thief spelling my name correctly is not relevant. If someone steals a car and crashes it, the insurance company is not going to tell the owner who reported the car as stolen \" We verified you were the driver during the accident because the spelling of your name in our records, matches the spelling of your name on the car registration '' That is what you are doing. You are using the fact that the information exists, to verify it belongs to me, after I notified you the information resulted from identity theft and supplied you as the information required by federal law. As stated in Federal statute, 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the existence of the information is not evidence the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer received any goods, services or money as a result of the information. That is exactly what you did. The court did not conduct a reasonable identity theft investigation for you regarding this and certify to you that they verified the bankruptcy was authorized by me or that I benefited from it I am appalled on the way TransUnion has handled this situation. TransUnions wilful and gross negligence violates is unlawful and unethical. This bankruptcy needs to be removed from my report.

It took a lot of time but I was able to pay the balance, get the fees + interest reversed and close the card, however, this is not enough.

I was told that I had to provide a debit card number, expiration date and CVV in order to have my payoff letter \" Generated '' - I hesitantly allowed them to use the card that was apparently already on file, though I personally never once gave them my debit card nor did I ever authorize them to have that. 2. I have since called back today, XX/XX/2019, as I have not received that payoff letter. The woman I spoke to was able to verify my email address and a comment about how someone was scheduled to send that ( which means they lied, they told me it was already sent during the first phone call ). So I asked if she could resend that. she refused. I asked her who could, She said her boss could but that he wasn't around. This is preventing me from buying a mortgage. My closing date is XX/XX/2019.\n",

In XXXX I was advised by someone to call Wells Fargo to see if I could lock in at my current interest rate of 2 %.

I informed the card representative that my daughter and I did not make these charges. He cancelled our cards. Later, I receivied a card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX that still had the two resort charges. I called a card representative and told him the two charges were on my bill. He cancelled our cards again. Next, I received a card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX that still had the resort charges and interest on those charges.

Therefore, we have billed your account {$600.00}. This correction shows on your XX/XX/XXXX statement. We now consider this investigation complete. '' I then sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX saying I had not received a credit of {$600.00} from the resort. The card company then replied by their letter strangely dated XX/XX/XXXX saying I was previously rebilled for the {$600.00} charge, and they had recredited my account for this amount. The adjustment would appear within one to two billing cycles.The card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX showed the {$600.00} credit, but it showed a balance that included the original fraudulent charges plus interest. ( I admit that I did not initially notice that the original fraudulent charges were still included in the balanced owed. ) I then sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX saying that my card bill should only contain my current charges. I want my futures billings to only show what is owed from current charges and no interest. I always pay the full blance that I owe on my cards ( minus fraudulent charges ) so that I never incur any interest.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I called bridgecrest costumer service representative to ask for a payment extension. This information came from their website, it is to help people when they are in need. Well the young lady that I talked to, refused to address the program at first. She was a very fast talker and persuaded me to pay something as if it was going to help with the payment extension. So I paid {$150.00} out of {$420.00}. She asked if she could schedule a payment of {$420.00}. I agreed thinking this would help prevent me from receiving a late payment. She took my debit card information and immediately tried to take the money out right then. This resulted in an insufficient fund fee. The money that was deducted for the fee then decreased the amount available for the bill that was supposed to come out. So I ended up with 2 fees for that one as well. I had to pay over {$1400.00} in repairs and I pay for rides to go to work. So pushing the payment back would have been life-saving for me. So she didnt do the plan, I received a 30 day late on My credit report dropping me 75 points. This was what I was trying to avoid. I explained this to her. But she didnt care. I called customer dispute, but she told me after pulling the call that she didnt sign me up like promised and that she wasnt able to remove the late payment. Even though I followed the protocol. I havent had one bad experience with bridgecrest despite the reviews. Their website says they strive for customer service. I just want them to live up to it.

We then called Wells Fargo, staying on the line over an hour, and were told that the issue was settled. In XX/XX/XXXX, we received another letter -- same issue. We immediately called and again stayed on the line for almost two hours, this time while the Wells Fargo rep called XXXX. When she finally returned, she assured us that this time the problem had been dealt with. The next letter we received from Wells Fargo informed us that since we had not purchased wind coverage, they were buying a policy for us -- for {$1300.00}, {$500.00} more than the policy we bought from XXXX. Once again, we called, were on the line over two hours, and found out that Wells Fargo needed a declaration page from XXXX. It is a mystery to us why that fact had not been revealed previously. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo went ahead and took {$1300.00} out of our escrow account for the policy we did not need. The failure of Wells Fargo to correct an error they made, one that they assured us had been corrected three times, is unacceptable. We are older people with health issues, and this has caused us a great deal of stress and worry. We read over complaints on your web site and found others have had the same problem with Wells Fargo, so we can't help but wonder if this is a new scam cooked up to defraud consumers, similar to the credit card scam in recent years. We have advanced college degrees and were able to navigate the extremely and unnecessarily complex process to have this problem fixed. Many consumers would not have resources to do so. We would like assurance that, going forward, Wells Fargo will correct their errors quickly and with less time and effort required by their customers.\n",

Somehow somewhere, someone has my $XXXX which was paid by my bank. I gave more than enough time for the cashier department to fix it especially after they said they received all the proof.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Experian recently investigated a bankruptcy that has appeared on my credit report for more then 5 years, having been provided a document from the original creditor that reported the item, as identified by Experian, XXXX XXXX third party provider. With that document in hand, Experian reported that they verified the item is mine, but in alternate, having been provided documents from the social security administration of the only provided name identification with my social security number, Experian decided on its own to add names to my file without factual verification. In addition due to the unsecurity of the credit reporting system of Experian during the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2019, Experian has allowed some person or entities to run my credit, access my credit, or gain access illegally without permissible purpose over 65 times, when addressed with Experian their tag line is with permissible purpose, but having been unable to provide a credit application signed to give such access. In fact having contacted each of the entity, no credit application of signature available, each indicated that such was performed by phone or by the internet, without identifying verification. Experian is operating a lying dispute process, and a credit reporting company that allows access, without verification of its vendors.\n",

I immediately called RMCB and asked why they did not provide proper validity of the debt and I was told by a representative they were unable to provide the items requested in my letter do to HIPPA Laws .... So I further ask the representative about the information I received about the debt that didnt have a signature and she made it very clear the information was not sent by their company and that the original creditor sent the information. So I immediately called the original creditor to ask why they did not provide a signature on the documents I received. XXXX made it very clear they did not send the documents and asked me what was the name on the actual exterior envelope? I then told the representative of XXXX it was sent from RMCB which is why I was calling because I was confused to who sent it. She indicated what the documents was but informed me they did not send them as stated by RMCB that denied sending them. So I am first not understanding why RMCB would deny sending this info and why RMCB is not respecting the law thats very clear according to FTC and FDCPA, for a proper validation of debt.\n",

All Synchrony ever wanted was complete payment of any past due account, with all kinds of interest and late fees.

And up until all this started happening, I had MORE THAN TEN YEARS of use of their accounts with no late payments or any other problems.

      "VALUE OF S is This complaint is in regards to U.S. Banks lack of providing financial relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. Bank website is deceiving and contrary to the customer service representatives ( CSR ) information provided over the phone. Online does not provide any detailed forbearance information but over-the-phone a CSR said a Relationship Manager would provide repayment options AFTER enrolling in the \" forbearance '' assistance program with no ability to know what the repayment options would be prior to enrolling. The CSR then said it was guaranteed that a Relationship Manager would provide a repayment plan in which the lump sum would not be required after 180 days of forbearance. Then, after further conversation, the CSR said it was NOT a guarantee that the Relationship Manager would have a repayment plan and that the lump sum COULD be required after 180 days. Thus, forcing customer accounts to go into default and potential foreclosures. With a company as large as U.S. Bank, it is imperative to have correct, detailed, and accurate information for customers to make an informed decision. Most forbearance assistance programs offer placement of payments on the end of the mortgage loan ; however, U.S. Bank is not providing ANY forbearance options, but rather a way to place financially strained customers in a further bind by using deceitful language to its customers.\n",

After placing several calls requesting a copy of my entire payment history, XXXX, customer service representative, advised me this request will have to be submitted via email. On XX/XX/XXXX, an attempt via email was made to obtain a copy of my payment history beginning with origination date to present, which has not been received as of date.The original loan amount was approximately {$32000.00}, with monthly payments being {$410.00}, my payment being made in XX/XX/XXXX, which I continue to pay as of present. I currently send this company {$200.00} bi-weekly which are paid through my bank via my pay. I can't seem to understand how I have paid this debt for 18 years and still have a remaining balance of {$27000.00}.

This can not be, this finance company is fraudulently taking my money by adding astronomical interest to this loan. Ditech is making false representations about amounts owed as I do not owe the above stated amount. According to the loan statement, my current interest rate is 14.999 % with only {$70.00} being place toward the principal of this loan.

Due to the fact that Navy Federal Credit Union either refused or failed to provide the essential transactional information I requested I informed Navy Federal Credit Union that I would cease to remit any payments to Navy Federal Credit Union as I was not sure and had doubts of the accuracy of the information of the auto loan agreement we signed. On several occasions in XXXX and XXXX Navy Federal Credit Union contacted me about payment to my auto loan agreement. I never informed Navy Federal Credit Union that I refused or did not want to pay, I merely informed Navy Federal Credit Union that I would make payments upon receiving the transactional information I requested to ensure I was making the correct payments and in accordance with the agreement. I informed Navy Federal Credit Union that there was an error in my auto loan agreement and that I wanted to review the information first before making payments. Navy Federal Credit Union refused to provide the information. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, without notice to me that Navy Federal Credit Union would take my automobile nor a Warrant issued by a Court of Law was presented to me as the Authority to take my automobile. Navy Federal Credit Union took my automobile without my knowledge consent nor authority to take the automobile.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is In XX/XX/XXXX I applied for and received an online loan from XXXX. The loan amount was {$800.00} with 17 payments of {$130.00} totaling {$2200.00}. I made several payments totaling {$930.00} which was more than the amount we loaned to me. In XXXX, I had some financial and health issues come up and I couldnt make my payments. Not knowing what the online lender could do I contacted the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions and the Indiana Secretary of State, both of which informed me that XXXX wasnt licensed in the state of Indiana, theyre tribal leaders and charged illegal rates of interest. They advised me that the loans were illegal thus making them null, void and uncollectable. Upon receiving this information I contacted XXXX via phone and told the what I was told. After that conversation I still received emails from them trying to collect money from me. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an alert from my credit monitoring app that a collection account was added. The account was reported by - Complete Credit Solutions , Inc . In regards to the XXXX account. After making several phone calls I was told that XXXX sold my account to this company. I contacted XXXX and once again advised them that the loan was illegal thus making it null, void and uncollectableband that they needed to pull back my account from the collection agency. They said they a case manger would look into it. I wasnt given any time or even the persons name. I then contacted Complete credit solutions- who were very rude and basically said that they have money on this account and I needed to pay. I advised them that the loan was null, void and uncollectable but they insisted that this legal for them to report this to the credit bureau. I have since then filed a dispute within the credit bureau XXXX. I also had another loan with XXXX that I received in XX/XX/XXXX paid in full in XX/XX/XXXX. Loan amount was {$800.00} total amount paid {$2000.00}.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I received a credit alert via e-mail at XXXX pm CST via my XXXX Protect My ID program. I logged in and saw that BMO was reporting my account delinquent. I called XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire about it, but that phone kept asking for my phone number and PIN but never led to an actual person. I then called XXXX and ended up talking to XXXX. He explained the XX/XX/XXXX payment was not received. Told him I sent it. He said because it was not a full payment, it was not applied. Paul admitted BMO has my mortgage payment, but BMO is refusing to apply it. During the conversation I learned my monthly payment had increased and that BMO never notified me of this. XXXX said BMO mailed me 2 notices, but when I asked him to give me the dates of the notices, he said he didn't have access to that. We went back and forth about the notices, he claiming I had received them but never producing any actual proof I had. I asked him to tell me what address BMO had sent the notices to, but he was unable to tell me either. We were not getting anywhere, so I asked to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold and told me his manager, XXXX, was on the phone with someone else and to give him a number XXXX could call me at. After my phone call with XXXX ended, I started looking at the statements online, my preferences and my paper files to try to better understand what was going on. The last paper statement I have from BMO was the one dated XX/XX/XXXX. The last escrow analysis I received from them via mail was dated XX/XX/XXXX for changes effective XX/XX/XXXX. Every year, once I receive that, I make changes to my monthly payment. However, I did not receive any escrow analysis in the mail for changes effective XX/XX/XXXX. I then turned my electronic version of my account with BMO. I went to the paperless statement setting to see if I could find any answers, but BMO tells me that I \" don't have eligible accounts for paperless statements. '' I then checked the settings for security alerts and notifications and alerts, BMO has my current e-mail and phone numbers but never sent me an e-mail or a text about the change if payment and the so-called delinquency. I don't even get notices from BMO that a monthly statement is available. I then tracked down the electronic statements to see what answers I could find. It turns out that the mailing address on those documents is \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Return Mail, IL. '' Even the escrow analysis for changes effective XX/XX/XXXX doesn't even have my address!\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I contacted my loan company M and T Bank about placing a forbearance on my mortgage payments due to COVID, which are XXXX a month. They agreed to a 6 month forbearance but, when I asked that the payments be placed on the end of my loan, they said they could not do that. I mentioned that was an option under the CARES act, but they only said they could review my situation at the end of the forbearance period. When I asked if all my payments would come due at one time at the end of the forbearance, they said yes. I then mentioned that under the CARES act, that I could avoid that, but all they kept saying is that they would review the situation at the end of the six months. I am now in a forbearance plan facing an uncertain future about what I will owe at the end of six months, and the consequences of what will happen if I have to pay 6 mos of mortgage at one time.

      "VALUE OF S is In XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX to request a refund of a fee they were charging me that I had previously requested NOT be put on my mortgage statement as I had been in contract to sell me house since XXXX and the closing was scheduled for XX/XX/2018. Unbeknownst to me, the representative I had spoken to reversed my entire XXXX mortgage payment instead of just crediting me the {$7.00} that was erroneously taken out of my checking account. Upon attending our closing, and our title closer speaking with the representative from XXXX XXXX and receiving the closing figures, we successfully concluded our closing thinking everything was fine. A month later I received a notice from XXXX XXXX advising we were in arrears in our mortgage payment. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX explaining that we had closed that account on XX/XX/18. They advised that they indeed saw the money for the pay-off of the mortgage however it was being held in a suspense account pending further investigation. I told them to expeditiously examine the issue and get back to me asap. After not hearing from them for over a week, I called the servicing center and spoke to an agent that informed me I owed them {$2000.00} for XXXX mortgage payment. I said that was incorrect as I was enrolled in EFT which automatically pays my mortgage. I was then apprised with the fact that XXXX XXXX had reversed the entire mortgage payment for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX instead of crediting me the {$7.00} I had requested. I told them at no time was I EVER made aware that the entire XXXX payment was being reversed as I would not have allowed that to happen. They told me they would \" look into this ''. I also advised them that THEIR AGENT gave the figures at the closing on XX/XX/XXXX which indicated that XXXX XXXX knew the payment was reversed and should have included that in the closing numbers. I then went back and forth with XXXX XXXX for several weeks regarding this disaster speaking with agent after agent and vehemently demanded that no action be taken with any credit agency until AFTER a full investigation of the issue was resolved as this was surely the fault of XXXX XXXX. I was assured by a supervisor at XXXX XXXX that indeed no action would be taken. In XXXX, I was notified by the credit agencies that our credit score had dropped over 200 points due to late payments on our mortgage! I again contacted XXXX XXXX demanding they reverse this negative report only to be told they can not. I am sure you know that a negative report against a mortgage is a killer to your credit. I have not been contacted by XXXX XXXX and am pleading for help with this company that has the absolute worst reputation in the industry.\n",

Credit cards been in good standards, I always use my credit card no more than XXXX XXXX dollars and I pay it back same billing period.

With all this being said I did all this to get my credit back in good standing so they were to report it, because I was moving and needed to get a credit check, I then find out XX/XX/XXXX that they reported me as not making a payment in XX/XX/XXXX and haven't reported ANY of my current payments - I called them and spoke to several people who said they have to follow the fair credit reporting standards etc etc however the agent I spoke to, XX/XX/XXXX said they dont have to report me as making payments and positive until I am in good standing, but yet that doesn't seem correct because I have made payments and you are reporting me as XX/XX/XXXX NOT making a payment then XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX you have no payments at all reflected, I can understand XX/XX/XXXX but NOT XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

      "VALUE OF S is Since 2008, I have kept very close monitoring of my credit ; however, in the past several years I have requested annually \" free '' credit reports AND scores, but have NEVER received any score from any of the three agencies. When requesting both, there is a box to check for both, but when the report is received it literally says, No Score is included with no information on how to obtain that \" free '' score without having to '' jump through more hoops '' and sign up to pay for it on another website. When calling the three agencies, I have been put on hold for more than 30 minutes to an hour and have NEVER received an answer or a response as to why I can not get my credit score as well as my report. The most notorious of the three reporting agencies is XXXX. You must sign up on line and pay for your score. Withholding a consumers financial history, in my opinion is equivalent to withholding critical medical information from a consumer that can assist them in improving their health. Consumers lacking easy access to their personal financial evaluations ; e.g. scores and reports does NOT allow them to negotiate effectively with lenders, but more importantly benefit from lower interest rates etc. they have worked so hard to EARN! I maintain excellent credit ; however, anytime I have applied for a loan of any kind, the lender has ALWAYS had a \" lower '' score than I was aware of which they use to increase my interest rates and thus costing me hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years! What is the point of withholding or making it nearly impossible for a consumer to obtain credit scores AND reports, but to give lenders and corporate entities a financial advantage over the consumer? If consumers are allowed BY LAW to have these reports annually, the three major reporting agencies should be abiding by these laws and not continuing to put barriers in the way of consumers obtaining critical financial information. And, if found in violation, these three agencies should return the hundreds of thousands of dollars lost to consumers since the receipt of a free annual free credit report and scores to consumers was signed into law.\n",

I was a holder among others of a credit card of a company that went out of business. The business owed the credit card money. They could not collect from the company because the company went broke. So the credit card company then sued all employees that held a company credit card. Not knowing i could be liable and the others also ignored the credit card company. they file suit against employees of which I was one an got a judgement against me and others for the company debt. XXXX judgement is on my report. If it is going to be there it should show the reason for the judgement which I am still contesting. Next, i am shopping for a mortgage. I am looking for a rate suitable for me. It may take one month. It may take six months. In the meantime hard pulls are being made and each time my credit score goes down and down. if you look at the payment portion of my credit it is 100 % on time, never late and paid the amount and sometime more each month. tis has dropped my score to low 600 's.

      "VALUE OF S is To Whom it May Concern : I'm currently a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that qualifies for XXXX Loan Forgiveness. According to the rules, I can get up to {$17000.00} because I have met the requirements for that particular forgiveness. I know this because I've had {$11000.00} forgiven in XX/XX/XXXX from my student loan balance of {$15000.00}. Currently, I have {$4400.00} left in 2 loans according to my XXXX account. My guarantor for these 2 loans are the state of Texas which is now Trellis Company. Trellis Company continues to create difficulties for my application in order to get the {$4500.00} forgiven.

The first time I applied was XX/XX/XXXX at the end of my 5 year. My last submission on XX/XX/XXXX, I made sure to clearly type the application and have the appropriate signatures done neatly by both myself and previous administrators. I was denied because I was told the application was \" too light '' and that they could not confirm that XXXX XXXX still works at the XXXX XXXX ( which he does ). No phone calls were made to the XXXX to verify his employment nor were there any contacts made to him directly. Now I am being asked to show his employment verification of his position which I am not allowed to request through my HR department. The first 6 times I applied, there was no mention about my previous XXXX 's status being a reason for denying my application. Now with my most recent denial, I'm being asked to do something that is not within my boundaries. For the past 8 months, I've made multiple phone calls ( at least twice a month ) to XXXX to verify the status of my application, I've submitted all the paper work every time, and everything is up to date. Because I have gotten loans forgiven for a my first application, I know my application is solid. I've been informed by XXXX, loan service provider, that my guarantor ( Trellis Company ) keep denying my application for the following reasons : 1- Illegibility 2- \" Too light '' 3- Updated information 4- XXXX XXXX verification of work ( without making any contact with the XXXX or person ) From the feedback that I am receiving, I am under the impression that Trellis refuses to forgive my loans and keep making me do the run-around until I give up and pay for my loans out of pocket. I have no issues with XXXX, since they have provided me with all the information I need. My problem is with Trellis Company.\n",

I know this cant be right because like I said I never had an account with this company. I want this company to provide me with the original contract that has my signature on it that proves that I opened this account and also to provide me with any type of agreement between me and this company that says I have an obligation to pay them. The FCRA says that a creditor must provide the consumer with original documentation bearing the signature that validates the account. I want the original contract bearing my signature, and if the original contract bearing my signature cant be provided I want this collection deleted from any of the credit reporting agencies that is being reported to.

At this point, XXXX said we need to re-start the process. XXXX called and collected {$550.00} application fees and my loan was submitted for underwriting around XX/XX/XXXX and a new appraisal was ordered. After getting the run around from underwriting for a month and still no progress till XXXX, i decided to go with XXXX XXXX for this transaction.

I found that their comments were appalling and outrageous. I have attached documents on unresolved issues, numerous complaints against FREEDOM Mortgage.\n",

They do allow some overdrafts but what they have been doing is actually clearing the debit or ach to the point on my end it shows as cleared and also they charge an NSF and then a day or so later they reverse the funds. It intermittently shows cleared even with the creditor. With the assessing of the fee and the item showing as cleared that depletes the balance even further and has caused additional NSF of things that may possibly have cleared if both the fee and transaction weren't both showing as cleared.

      "VALUE OF S is XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX XXXX To whom it may concern : This complaint is towards PayPal Credit ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I realized it was time for me to get assistance for this issue when this company deliberately refuse to put my money to the account to pay off the balance of the regular purchases. They want interests money, to fleece their customers. The last date I contacted PayPal was XX/XX/XXXX, prior to that I would call and call even on Saturday each time I was told the money would be applied to the proper account I would check online only to find no changes they would put the money towards the promotional balance even when it wasnt due. I would explain I wanted the regular purchases amount to be paid also that was the reason for paying the extra amount of money to cover the promotion balance and the regular purchases amount to keep from paying interests. The XXXX promotion is not due its a prime example of what they do but there is money that is not been accounted for that I have paid and I want to know where is the XXXX. What has this company done with my money? This would have been avoided if customer service would have been honest in posting my money where I requested. There is money unaccounted for in the amount of XXXX that I have paid. Since the beginning of the year, I have had a problem with customer service posting my money to the correct account. They refuse to put my money where I request to pay off the regular purchases as well as the promotional balance. There is special promotion finance where customers have six months to pay without interests also regular purchases if customers can pay within 30 days without interest. Each representative says something different each time I call. On XXXX, XXXX the promotion amount was XXXX I paid XXXX, I did not have a promotion for XXXX, but I paid XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX there were two promotional balances XXXX, I paid an additional XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I paid XXXX, XXXX promotion wasXXXX, I paid XXXX now I have paid XXXX. The total of promotion is XXXX XXXX = XXXX - XXXX = XXXX the balances towards my regular purchases. Customer services refuse to post the XXXX towards regular purchases in the total amount of XXXX instead they paid a portion of XXXX promotion amount XXXX leaving a balance of XXXX. There is money I have paid that is not being accounted for only XXXX was paid towards the XXXX promotion ( is not due ) leaving the balance of XXXX, only XXXX was paid out of the XXXX so where is the XXXX, it was not applied to the regular purchases, where is this money? Now because of their inappropriate conduct, they have charged XXXX also they have increased the regular purchases to XXXX this is a made-up amount. These are the regular purchases I made and date XX/XX/XXXX, amount XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, amount XXXX + XX/XX/XXXX, amount XXXX + XX/XX/XXXX amount XXXX + XX/XX/XXXX amount XXXX I did not see where I was given credit for these three amounts of XXXX so I added them to the total amount of XXXX. There was an error in my calculations in the purchases amount it is XXXX instead of XXXX. I have not charged anything to the regular purchases since XX/XX/XXXX purchases and never will anymore. I have paid the regular purchases customer services refuse to post the money to the account. This is wrong and unethical for this company to miss handle customer 's money who are paying their bill this is bad and unfair business practices. I have attached documents from my bank statement.

I could have reached out via these channels on my own without having to visit the AnnualCreditReport website and entering my SSN -- so what is the purpose of the AnnualCreditReport website?

Please find information from the Florida Department of Revenue supporting my assertion that the merchant, XXXX XXXX, is not obligated to collect sales tax on cosmetology e.g., hair and nail services, the merchant category code in which they operate. As stated previously, the amount of the original transaction was {$650.00} ( {$600.00} for services plus {$50.00} tip ). Not sure how they arrived at {$710.00}, since that doesnt calculate to the purported 7 % tax, over charging me {$60.00} above what was originally agreed. Barclays claim that they do not have any responsibility to assist in resolving this billing dispute since it was a card present and in person transaction is erroneous. Even Barclay 's own internal records support that the transaction was entered manually several times, with varying amounts. They obviously manipulated the amount after we left the establishment. Either they are guilty of incompetence or intentional fraud, but in either circumstance, I should not be held liable for merchant billing errors.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Our mortgage was transferred from XXXX to Shellpoint New Rez. When they did this, I set up a one time automatic payment thru my bank to NewRez to cover the 1st pmt. I paid {$1800.00} on XX/XX/19, which is the full mortgage payment for XX/XX/2019. NewRez then did an ACH for {$1800.00} on XX/XX/19, and took another ACH for {$1800.00} on XX/XX/19. I have called for a refund of the two erroneous payments. At first they told me that I must prove that they took the XX/XX/19 pmt, which I did. I have since spoken with at least 7 different reps at their call line, who each tell me that they are escalating. Each time they do this, they tell me that it will be 2-3 days, 24-48 hours, 4-5 days ... for us to see the refund in our bank account. I completed the \" Contact Us '' on their website 3 times, I faxed them with confirmation, and I also wrote a snail mail letter as they state that we have rights under the Federal Gov't. All of these attempts have provided NO response from this company. They destroyed our budget and put us in a negative with other debtors when they pulled a total of {$3600.00} that they were not entitled to. On top of this, the statement then showed that the next pmt was due XX/XX/2019, which is also incorrect - based upon these payments no pmt was due until XX/XX/2019. They've now moved the {$3600.00} to \" Unapplied Balance '' so it is not benefiting the interest on the mortgage either. I was told yesterday that this was escalated to this person 's supervisor who is the only one who will be able to find out why the escalations have not brought results. I was on the phone again today filing another complaint. I am now told that a XXXX XXXX will call me within 24-48 hours, so again we wait. Since it is XX/XX/2019 and payment is due no later than the 15th ( and I never wait this long ), they offered to move the unapplied balance to the loan. I don't trust them to do this, so filed the complaint once again today requesting the refund. I gave them the bank and routing number in one of the previous calls and was told we would see the funds back in our account within 24-48 hours. I have removed the banking information on our account with them so they can not do this again, and have set up automatic payments through our bank, but this does not resolve the situation that we have with them now.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I am requesting to remove the bankruptcy from my credit report because that on was to old and you supposed to removed a long time ago. Although it is your policy to keep reporting bankruptcies which are filed or adjudicated for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681c relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings. The law states from date of adjudication or date of order for relief. Any case, civil or otherwise, that has been dismissed no longer exists in the eyes of the law and a case filed may never have actually been adjudicated.

I'm initiating this complaint for the following reasons : ( 1 ) TransUnion MySmartmove should provide to the consumer a copy of the report that is identical to that provided to the landlord ; ( 2 ) TransUnion MySmartmove should provide this copy to the consumer via the consumer portion of the website, just as they provide it to the landlord via the website ; ( 3 ) TransUnion MySmartmove should not request consumers to email sensitive personal information ; and ( 4 ) TransUnion MySmartmove should provide their mailing address to send FCRA disclosure requests on their website.\n",

In previous calls trying to catch up I asked if I had late fees to pay and reps at times said no. What they really meant was you do n't have to pay them now. Slightly inaccurate when a customer ( me ) asks what is my late fee or when does it apply. Last XXXX XXXX, I called to make a payment ; the young lady said late fees go into effect on the XXXX so I could have a manager call me back. Wrong! Yes a manager could call me back but a late fee was applied to my account {$28.00} for waiting to hear back from a manager. I still offered to make a payment Thursday the XXXX so it 's Super upsetting to incur any fee for something you ask about directly and are misinformed about. She was wrong about the late feeShe was wrong about having a manger call me back. Someone called saying they were from US Bank and left vm with general XXXX numbers and no name. so I had to call back XXXX and start the request for manager to call back all over again. This is all happening so fast my XXXX credit rating has slipped below XXXX. Thanks US Bank for making it so difficult to get accurate information about payment and fees information. Your reps are wildly inconsistent. Are they trying to drive customers into further default? Is US Bank trying to cause consumers to default on home mortgages and they foreclose on them? I 'm back to work as will be paid in full as of XX/XX/2015. How about the rest of their customers who are n't as fortunate and have to go through the repeated misinformation and delays associated with trying to get right information and make right amounts of payments to get out from default.

I began making the payments to the mortgage company exactly as specified. 3. The servicer was changed ( or loan sold ) and I re-directed my payments to the new company ( BSI ). 4. After a few months, the new company began rejecting my payments, stating that they had no knowledge of the Plan, and started the foreclosure process. BSI states that they are refusing the payments because the loan is in foreclosure. 5. After much calling, faxing and emailing, I was able to get the company to recognize the Plan, which had been made an amendment to the original Security Deed and recorded with the State of Georgia. They adjusted their records, including loan balance, payment amount, interest rate, etc. They continue to refuse to accept the payment. They continue to charge fees for taxes and insurance ( via an escrow account ) even though the Plan specifically states that I am to pay the taxes and insurance directly : NO ESCROW ACCOUNT. The payments I've been sending ( {$140.00} ) are, of course, less than the amount they are requesting since the escrow amount is INVALID. 6. I have sent the company emails demonstrating that I've made each payment for the past 5 years and have sent proof of the insurance policies established and tax payments made. 7. I requested but have not received via email a Statement of all of my Post Petition Payments and fees. 8. The company has sent the last mortgage statement, indicating that the amount due is over {$4000.00}. This amount includes fees, property inspection charges, and grass cutting fees of over {$1900.00} each. Note that BSI NEVER CUT the grass ; I had the grass cut and paid the lawn contractor directly. I have requested a summary of all fees that have accrued on the account. None of these fees are valid since no payments have ever been missed. If BSI can indicate any payment of {$140.00} that I have missed, or any tax/insurance payment that I failed to make, I will send them the corresponding funds asap.

The fact is that these Student Loan Accounts are not mine. I did not open these accounts and did not even seek a high education or attend college. So these accounts do not belong to me. STUDENT LOAN CREDITORS : XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX Policy states ... According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT \" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ... ( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

To Whom it may concern : XXXX, XXXX, Trans Union According to The Ninth Circuit, in Pintos v. Pacific Creditors Association ( 9th Cir 2007 ) 504 F.3d 792 it decided that without a permissible purpose one is in violation of 15 U.S.C. Section 1681b. Based on this decision, it appears that your agency is in violation of furnishing a copy of my credit report to the below companies. As the court interpreted and based on has been done in my case, FACTA clearly states that one only has a permissible purpose for obtaining a credit report under 1681b ( a ) ( 3 ) ( A ) and when it is only in connection to a credit transaction in which a consumer has participated directly and voluntarily.

      "VALUE OF S is A USPS certified receipt mail letter was sent to TransUnion and delivered on Monday, XX/XX/2019 requesting validation of debt from a company called XXXX XXXX. In my request for validation, I reminded TransUnion that in accordance with their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 U.S.C. 1681g the consumer is entitled to said records from said company or agency, the requested records which prove/show that the debt is indeed mine that were given to Experian to validate this debt. They must in accordance with their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 U.S.C. 1681i delete this information from my credit report or send me copies of the documents that they have in their files with verifiable proof. I also requested correspondence be in writing. As of today, XX/XX/2019, Experian has not provided me with verifiable proof or copies of the documents used to validate this debt. Instead, on XX/XX/2019, the company sent me their investigation results to my dispute stated the information was investigated and that the debt was \" verified '' as accurate ( with no paperwork ). TransUnion is reporting incorrect information and refuses to produce record supporting documentation that any individual to whom gave the information or the documentation itself as requested. Consumer reporting agencies bear the responsibility to ensure the accuracy of all of the accounts they report and their responsibility must consist of more than merely parroting information received from other sources. An investigation that merely shifts the burden back to the credit grantor can not fulfill the obligations imposed by 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ).\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I received letters from the risk management dept of Wells Fargo telling me they were closing all my accounts. my 2 business accounts, my business savings, my 2 business lines of credit, my 2 personal accounts, my personal savings, my personal credit card, my personal line of credit, ALL my accounts. I have been a loyal customer of Wells Fargo for 34 years and all my accounts were in good standing. I thought this had to be a mistake so I spent endless hours on the phone talking to supervisor after supervisor seeking higher authority asking them to please correct this or give me an explanation. No matter who I spoke with all they said was it was a business decision and they don't have to give me a reason. This caused me thousands of dollars of my time and has caused me so much stress trying to seek answers and spending endless hours on the phone and searching for a new banking institution, setting up all my account, bill pay, ACH withdrawels, etc. My business is complex and this caused me at least 2 months of my time and the stress has been overwhelming. I even went in to the local branch and the manager could not give me any answers as they have no authority and I suppose if they stuck their neck out too far they would get fired. Wells Fargo is a Dirty bank that abuses their customers because they can get away with it. This has affected my credit score because of them closing my credit card and credit lines. I owe a balance on 2 of my business lines of credit totaling {$150000.00} and they are telling me because they are closed I need to pay them in full and they can not restructure them into a simple interest loan. They turned me over to their small business collections and offered me to pay 60 % of the loan and they would write it the rest off but it would affect my credit score. I can not come up with that kind of money nor do I want to harm my credit score. They have put me in difficult position along with the many hours, money and stress that comes with it. Last month I saw a few articles regarding Wells Fargo closing peoples accounts that shouldn't have been closed. A year ago we refinanced a home though a broker and Wells Fargo bought the mortgage. This last XX/XX/XXXX we moved and bought a home and Wells Fargo bought that mortgage so we are good enough for them to buy our mortgages but they cancel all my other accounts? This company needs to be accountable for their actions. I have attached some of the letters I received from them cancelling our accounts. Thank you, XXXX XXXX\n",

XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX I am outraged that your company continues to maintain a dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy as confirmed on my credit report. This unconfirmed, unverified, and dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy has stopped me from obtaining credit. I know for a fact your company receives information on bankruptcy from a third party system known as a XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX is inaccurate and incomplete since the XXXX XXXX does not provide complete social security numbers as that would be against the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Privacy Laws. Furthermore, I have been in contact with the county courthouse and they also assured me they do not report full social security numbers to thirty parties or make social security numbers public record. Even though it is your company 's policy to keep reporting a bankruptcy that is filed, dismissed, or adjudicated for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681 ( c ) relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings. The law is very clear and states from the date of adjudication or date of order of relief. Any case, whether it be civil or otherwise, once dismissed it no longer exists in the eyes of the law. This case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. You have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed non-existent. It is only fair that in accordance with section 1618 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act you delete this from my credit report and send me an updated copy. Considering this does not require an investigation, I would appreciate an updated copy of my credit report showing no bankruptcy within two weeks from the date you receive this letter.

      "VALUE OF S is We are still owed {$1700.00} which was taken back out of our account, since we did provide the proof and documentation in a timely manner to the Wells Fargo Claims department regarding our urgent matter involving the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which was bad workmanship relating to the transmission we paid for which was still leaking and he defrauded us out of the Money as well. When we provided the valid proof to Wells Fargo they should have kept the temporary credit of {$1700.00} on our account and have gone after the the monies via Visa/XXXX themselves versus causing a tremendous Financial Hardship on Consumers who are XXXX Minorities and U.S. Veterans who have served our Country. It was very unethical in the approach and discriminating tactic utilized by Wells Fargo in this case because they were well aware of the circumstance surrounding the claim when I initially reached out to them in XX/XX/XXXX. When I first spoke to a representative in on XX/XX/XXXX, they stated they did not need further other information regarding the claim after taking it over a call. We then later received a letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX, stating Wells Fargo was going to reverse the temporary credit because they had not received the requested information regarding the claim. What requested information? You never stated during our call on XX/XX/XXXX that I needed to send in any additional information based on the dispute call submitted. Also, I checked my Wells Fargo portal to login to see if I had previously received any email alerts regarding requested information, since the first claim was submitted and confirmed I had not received any communication in my portal since XX/XX/XXXX regarding this matter. Therefore, the letter we received in the mail XX/XX/XXXX, was the 1st contact we received from Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive an Voicemail from Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. Also, if they were really making an attempt to request additional information on XX/XX/XXXX, why did they not send an email on the secured Wells Fargo Portal where all the Disputes are filed and posted with updates. We also agreed to be notified via email at the onset of the claim being submitted as well. Also, when we initially received the first and only letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX, I immediately reached out to Wells Fargo to inform them I had not received any communication from them that stated or suggested they were attempting to contact me regarding Claim XXXX for {$1700.00} and only during this phone call was I provided what I needed to do at this point. On the following day, XX/XX/XXXX, an email and corresponding attachments which are included in this claim were sent to Wells Fargo including text messages exchanged between myself and the mechanic regarding the defaulted and fraudulent service provided to my vehicle regarding a supposedly fixed transmission which was not repaired. From this point, we did not receive any further communication until XX/XX/XXXX, stating they would be reversing the {$1700.00} credit, utilizing an excuse stating that you authorized the transaction. Regardless, if you authorized the transaction, it was still completed under false prentenses from the XXXX XXXX XXXX, as they did not repair the vehicle appropriately and we provided this proof of information and documentation to Wells Fargo on several occasions and the credit of {$1700.00} should have remained on our account versus causing an overbearing hardship and burden to XXXX XXXX American Consumers due to greed and lack of care exhibited by Wells Fargo to ensure their customer remained unharmed. They would rather have the consumer take the loss in the interim versus pursuing the monies after receiveing the required proof regarding this fraudulent transaction. Therefore, we are requesting that our {$1700.00} be refunded immediately and Wells Fargo retrieve the money via Visa/the Merchant based on provided proof and communications sent to Wells Fargo multiple times. We should not have to wait for Wells Fargo to retrieve the funds from the Merchant because you were provided with the documentation and proof that this was a fraudulent transaction due to bad /misrepresented services received. Also, we had prior debit commitments which are still due to hit our account and are requesting waiving/refunds for any overdraft charges, as a result of this valid consumer dispute regarding fraudulent charges and services were not provided as indicated in the customer/merchant agreement.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Dear Sir or Madam : I am writing to dispute a debit in the amount of {$1300.00} on my account. The amount is inaccurate because the merchandise I ordered was not delivered. I ordered the merchandise on XX/XX/19. I received the package on XX/XX/19, but opened the package on XX/XX/19. Upon opening the package, ( package came in a shipping bag instead of a box ) I noticed that the box of the product had already been opened and was not sealed in the plastic shrink-wrap that it would come with. When I opened the box, all of the contents were missing. Instead of what I ordered there was a heavy egg shaped granite sphere and what looks like a base that holds it. I immediately contacted the merchant through email as they are a XXXX company and I did not have a way to call. I explained to them that I received the package, but the contents were not what I ordered. The merchant explained to me they would contact their warehouse and email me once they received a response. On XX/XX/19 the merchant contacted me to explain that the warehouse informed them they had indeed shipped out the item. The issue at hand isn't if the warehouse shipped/did not ship the item. The issue is that the package that was shipped out was fraudulent, and did not have the items I ordered. The merchant explained to me there was nothing they could do and that I needed to contact my local shipping courier. Immediately after the merchant informed me of this, I inspected the shipping bag that the package came in. This shipping bag did not appear to have been tampered with, as the only cut was the one I had just made to open the package. Being a bag instead of a box would have made it difficult to hide any type of tampering. A bag would continue to show an opening no matter how it is taped as opposed to a box which can be opened and re-tapped without anyone 's knowledge. I proceeded to contact USPS and explained to them the situation. They let me know that this is something they would be looking into and would contact me by email. USPS sent back an email stating the package had been delivered without issue, and was delivered the same way they received it. I contacted the merchant and explained that USPS had completed their investigation and deemed that the package was delivered in the same condition it was sent. The seller then gave me the same reply to check with the shipping company which sent the item to me. This is the point at which I contact my bank and file a dispute explaining what happened.\n",

After speaking to several barclay reps I'm still getting charged interest thus far of XXXX, despite paying my balance off again in full again and paying extra on my card.

      "VALUE OF S is About 2 1/2 years ago I purchased a truck from XXXX 's XXXX XXXX located on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, N.Y.

I was told by XXXX 's XXXX XXXX that in order for me to get financed I had to put an extended warranty on the vehicle, I explained that the vehicle would be used at times for commercial purposes. They told me \" don't put any lettering on the vehicle. '' I canceled the extended warranty because it did not cover the truck if it was used for commercial purposes. I was told that the cost and finance charges for the warranty would come off the back end of the loan. After further reading the paperwork I realized XXXX 's XXXX XXXX had arbitrarily raised the price to {$17000.00} without telling me and after I paid them the down payment of {$3000.00}. When I confronted them I was told that Credit Acceptance told them to raise the price, all this without ever telling me they were raising the price. So I called Credit Acceptance and complained about the bait and switch, they denied ever telling XXXX 's XXXX XXXX to do that. I told them I wanted this corrected and was told their legal dept would contact me. The Legal Dept never contacted me but when I got behind in my payment Credit Acceptance had the truck repossessed without warning and by that I mean I had to agree to let XXXX 's XXXX XXXX put a device on the truck that would beep 3 times as a warning that a payment was due. The contract stated that this warning would be every time I started the truck for three days and if payment was not received then the device would not let me start the truck. I did not receive any warning as per the agreement in the contract. After the truck was repossessed I was never given any information about what it sold for at auction, as required by law, or that the {$3000.00} added to the truck by XXXX 's XXXX XXXX or the credit for the canceled extended warranty was ever credited to me. When I called Credit Acceptance about all of this complaint I was told just give us {$5000.00} and we will call it even. I want this removed from my credit report and shown as paid.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is We recently had a credit of {$1700.00} in XXXX which was reposted back to our our account after it was previously deducted back out of our account due to a 3rd party vendor fraudulent charge on our account which caused us {$340.00} in fees since XX/XX/XXXX and was told that overdraft fees would be reversed back into our account, once the credit or {$1700.00} reposted back to our account.

This is not true. Wells Fargo Claims and Customer Service Reps did not make a concerted effort to help us resolve this matter and are reaching out to CFPB to help us with this matter. Also, we experienced some retailiation from the Wells Fargo Claims or Banking Department since we filed a couple of compliants with CFPB regarding the {$1700.00} which was previously taken back out of our account, although they were provided with proper documentation. We have since experienced retaliation in being able to utilize the overdraft protection program which we have affiliated with this card. Also, they rejected a Utilities Bill payment which came through for {$50.00} and believe this was done intentionally as a result of us previously reporting Wells Fargo on several occasions regarding the {$1700.00} debit matter. Also, they have restricted the card with being able to get cash back which was also previously part of the Overdraft Protection plan as well. We are now being punished and retailiated against because reported them and can not fully utilize the Premium benefits associated with my Checking account.

First they turned off my auto debit for my payment, I called and was told auto debit was not an option even though I had it for over a year. Called back again and someone said it was an option and wasnt sure why I was told that. Auto debit was turned back on, then Sallie Mae continued to pull my payment from the incorrect bank account after I had called twice to update it, they charged me late fees for an error that they made. Now every month I have to call to set up a payment and sometimes I am told auto debit is on and sometimes I am told I have no auto debit on my account. All payments are up to date, and since XX/XX/2020 I have been fighting with them because they are saying my account is past due when I literally spoke with someone and have emails showing the payment being processed.

One told me I owed {$400.00}, another told me {$900.00}, another told me {$700.00} and another told me {$1600.00}. When I asked why that was the balance owed when I made all payments her response was well I didnt really look into it so you mean to tell me youre a rep for a student loan company and you tell someone information about a payment and you dont really look into it? They told me to submit my bank statements showing proof of payment, I did, then they call back a few days later saying they cant find the bank statements I submitted. And then tell me a new balance is owed. How is there a new balance owed every time? And how is there a payment due when Ive made the payments? They offer no solutions, they offer no alternatives, they have no knowledge of anything they are talking about. Every single person I speak to has something different to say about my account but not a single person can offer a helpful solution. This is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with and I have no idea how they are even operating. The most unprofessional, unknowledgeable company in student loans.

It also governs creditors, collection agencies and other businesses that furnish information ( furnishers ) to the CRAs. The FCRA provides victims of identity theft with numerous rights. Consumers can bring legal claims against the CRAs and furnishers if they fail to comply with the FCRA. The most important right is the blocking of information on a credit report that resulted from identity theft. A CRA must block the reporting of any fraudulent information within four business days of receiving a dispute from a consumer that contains : Identification of the fraudulent information ; A copy of an identity theft report ( an identity theft report is an official, valid report filed by the consumer with a federal, state or local law enforcement agency including the post office ) ; A statement by the consumer that the information is not related to any transaction by the consumer ; and Appropriate proof of identity. The CRA must notify the furnisher of the information that it has blocked the information as fraudulent. The CRA will also notify the two other national CRAs that it has blocked the information. The consumer should receive a letter from the CRA stating that the information has been blocked. If the consumer sends the CRA the required materials and the CRA does not block the disputed information within four days, the consumer can bring a legal claim against the CRA.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I'm having an issue with CitiCards. When I make a payment for my statement balance in full, the last two times they have always requested/received TWO full statement balance payments from my bank. So, I've had the same issue happen twice now. It happened once on XX/XX/XXXX. It just happened again today/yesterday. The payment is still processing/pending with my bank. So, inXX/XX/XXXX, I scheduled a payment for {$900.00}. It was scheduled at some point in advance of XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my checking account with XXXX XXXX XXXX that was being used to pay the credit card bill is charged for {$900.00} TWICE. My credit card bill then starts to show a balance of NEGATIVE {$900.00}. I didn't think much of it at the time because I thought I may have scheduled two payments on the same day by accident and not checked the scheduled payments. I carried a negative balance on the card for a while and had no need to make a payment in XX/XX/XXXX. When the billing cycle payment due date came around in XX/XX/XXXX, I had a bill for {$91.00}. I used the mobile app to schedule payment XX/XX/XXXX. I checked it to confirm there was only ONE listed scheduled payment. That was all I ever saw. I received an email from Citi cards telling me that my payment was received and then I saw something showing I had a NEGATIVE balance again. I contacted CitiCards today through their chat platform. The person was helpful, but I have no sense of this actually being resolved. I contacted my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, to confirm it wasn't on their end. They said they received two authorizations in XX/XX/XXXX and there are two more coming in for this recent instance. XXXX XXXX XXXX offered to put in fraud claims for any/all of the charges, but I elected to not pursue that at this time because I don't want \" block '' myself from paying my own credit card bill. I was concerned that would lead to late fees or interest fees with Citi that I would have to discuss with them. I requested that I receive an email or phone call of some kind to verify that this is taken care of. It seemed as though they will apply this information to my account, but I have no idea if anything will change. I just wanted to get this out there because if people are carrying a relatively low checking account balance, this DOUBLE billing practice may result in fees from their bank or wherever they are drawing from to pay their credit card.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I froze my credit file with all three major credit reporting agencies back in 2006. I had some practical issues unfreezing the credit reports last year. This year I contacted all three credit reporting agencies via U.S. Mail ( see attachment ), asking them to check that the information they had on file was up to date. I also asked them, very clearly, to keep the freeze on my credit file. I also asked them for clear updated instructions on how to unfreeze my credit file, if that need were to arise sometime soon. These actions on my part are good standard practices to prevent fraud and identity theft. XXXX and XXXX responded adequately they got it right. Experian did not only get it wrong, they got it BACKWARDS! Think of backwards as being super-duper wrong. Extremely nonsensically wrong. So wrong that a thinking person would curl up in a corner and die of embarrassment for being stupid. Experian permanently removed the security freeze on my credit file!!! Now instead of having my credit file safely frozen, they've opened it up for the whole world. This is exactly the opposite of what I wanted to be done. I'm not going to charge them any money, at this time, for pointing out a terrible flaw in their business system of correspondence via U.S. Mail. Additionally, they allowed an incorrect XXXX XXXX XXXX to be available on the Internet. Having the wrong XXXX XXXX # caused a 2-3 week delay in communicating with them via U.S. Mail. It was very difficult to find someone to talk to at Experian to finally get the correct XXXX XXXX #. Experian should not be allowed to hide behind some defense of incompetence or error. Let 's be honest, Experian loses money on credit freezes and will do almost anything to discourage and confuse consumers into properly using credit freezing/unfreezing options.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I XXXX XXXX realizes that the debt collection process is complicated. In 2017 the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Henson v. Santander Consumer Financial USA, whereas third-party ownership voids my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Several of my old charges were never transferred to new ownership with written verification or validation, just a one page letter claiming that the original debt was sold. I am willing to settle on my old accounts that are still legitimately within the 6-year charge off timeline to enforce collections. However, I request a copy of the actual transfer rights of ownership. This is mandatory in any state or federal court jurisdiction where applicable. I also request the actual purchase price on transfer, which is only fair on any negotiated settlement. Accordingly, I request full disclosure from all debt ownerships, and if possible a reasonable settlement offer on the basis from the charged off date. I am entertaining a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy petition in the meantime, and will pull that trigger if there is no other alternative.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is My name is XXXX XXXX and I am writing about the inaccurate information that continues to report on my credit file.

On XXXX and XXXX this same report shows zero lates. I have requested this to be corrected but Experian several times to no avail.

I have also reached out to the CEO of Experian for assistance in this matter as this has been going on for well over a year. The fraudulent account to be deleted and blocked is XXXX.

      "VALUE OF S is This is regarding dispute numbers XXXX and XXXX. The purchases were from Home Depot. Dispute XXXX was originally for {$160.00} and {$82.00} was disputed. It doesnt list the dispute date on my dispute history but does list when it was resolved in my favor which was XX/XX/2019. Citibank issued me a credit, then a conditional credit, then a permanent credit with no additional documentation required. The dispute was over XXXX seed that failed to properly germinate and the store refused to take the item back. Despite honoring the dispute in my favor, Citibank also paid the merchant, because they stated it was a valid purchase and it did not meet their return policy even though the webpage for XXXX seed contradicts their store return policy. The manager at the Home Depot states Citibank originally approved my dispute and Home Depot appealed it, so they were eventually paid. At no time did Citibank ask me for supporting documentation for my side of the story. I would have happily provided them with the website information or I would have taken it up with Home Depots home office through the XXXX. Dispute XXXX was originally for {$10.00} on XX/XX/2019. The item was disputed on XX/XX/2019 for {$10.00}. Citibank issued me a credit, then a conditional credit, then a permanent credit with no additional documentation required. The history shows resolved on XX/XX/2019. The dispute was over two bags of lime : one bag was damaged by water and the other bag was torn and leaked all over my car. I called the store to complain when I arrived home and discovered the problem. I returned the item, but they failed to properly process the return to my credit card. Despite honoring the dispute in my favor, Citibank also paid the merchant, because they stated the item was never returned. XXXX in the executive office at Citibank stated the lime bags were not damaged, the lime did not leak in my car, and I did not try to call the store. The manager of the Home Depot states they would never make these allegations, so XXXX was just making non-objective and accusatory accusations. Citibank records calls for quality assurance, so they will have a recorded copy of the phone call. I am asking that the CFPB ask for a copy of the recorded conversation. The only paperwork according to the store manager that is seen during the dispute process is what their home office sends them ; a signed receipt and the reason for the dispute. Then, they validate whether they believe it is a valid charge. At no time did Citibank ask me for supporting documentation for my side of the story. I would have happily provided them with what they needed to resolve the dispute or I would have taken it up with Home Depots home office through the XXXX in order to resolve it on my own. Obviously, well outside of the 60-90 day dispute period, I would not still have possession of the receipt. I believed Citibank resolved it in my favor, believing the store supported the claim that the item was returned. I have been working with a rep through the XXXX ; they have offered to refund the seed and the lime based on the documentation I provided to the store. They are refunding it to my Citibank account. Despite acknowledgement that the website is indeed wrong and that the lime should have been properly refunded ( e-mail correspondence ), they required me to sign an accommodation agreement before they would refund the amounts to my credit card. This includes waiving the right to litigate for how this was transacted. While part of this is on Home Depot, Citibank clearly had an obligation to investigate this properly and to ask me for supporting documentation. Asking me for these documents would have avoided this entire problem. I wouldnt have needed to sign an agreement under duress just to prove to Citibank that the refunds/disputes should have been properly handled. Obviously, taking a gift certificate from Home Depot would have been of no use. I am also asking that Citibank send me the full dispute history on these disputes including the merchants response. I have been e-mailing billing disputes about these charges since the XX/XX/XXXX, but I dont think I have previously requested these documents. I am attaching the following documents for the CFPBs records : The XXXX Home Depot PDF file, an e-mail conversation history with the Home Depots rep, copies of e-mails to billing disputes, copies of the dispute summary, and dispute letter showing one of the credits was permanent. Most of my other dispute letters have disappeared from the Notices and Letters page of their website.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Hi,I recently discovered that my bank, USAA placed a hold on all of my checking accounts for varying amounts of money due to the fact that the state of Virginia placed a incorrect funds hold. The state of Virginia believed that I owed back taxes for 2015 but they were incorrect because I did not live in Virginia in 2015 then or now. I was required to fax my tax documents to the state of Virginia in order for them to removed the hold on my accounts. Once, the hold was removed, I discovered my bank USAA had charged me XXXX fee for legal services rendered. I feel this is an unfair and unjust charge as I did not owe back taxes to the state of Virginia, therefore, should not owe XXXX. I disputed the charge with no success because they stated its their policy and will not budge under any circumstances.This fee seems more like a scam between banks and the state. The state falsely places a hold on someones account and when rightfully disputed, they release the funds but the bank unfairly profits. This scam could have attacked hundreds to thousands of people creating a significant source of income for a bank. How a bank can justify its use in fees in beyond me in this case.Is there any legality to these legal fees? Is there any process that I can take on to get this investigated in an official capacity? What is my recourse for this?I appreciate any help that you can give at this time.Thanks,XXXX XXXX\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Barclays Visa regarding transactions on my credit card statement. Barclay offered transfer balances/promotional checks interest free through specified dates. I availed myself of those \" convenience checks '' and used them since there the interest rate is 0 % through specified dates. Upon reviewing the schedule of convenience checks which were used, I learned from the credit card company of how they post the payments which are made to the account. The complaint that I am filing due to the fact that the methodology used to apply the consumer payments is an abusive practice which puts the consumer at a significant disadvantage and allows the credit card company to manipulate the payments made on the account in a manner which unfairly penalizes the consumer. Here is what they do : There is a balance carried on Standard Purchases : in my case it was {$1000.00} ( 29 % APR ) There are also numerous Balance Transfer/Check Promotions which were taken out by me on numerous occasions with different ending promotional dates upon which any remaining balance will then be charged at the specified interest rate of 29 %. I make payments greater than the minimum amount. I was expecting that the entire payment amount would be applied to the balance with the highest interest rate. I wanted to payoff the balance since there is an APR of 29 % whereby the other balance transfers have a 0 % APR until a date out in the future. Barclays stated that anything above the minimum amount is applied to the other balance transfer/check promotions in any manner which they desire to apply them. I requested that they apply the entire payment that I made to the amount with the highest interest rate but they stated that they will not do it. The company then proceeded to apply the remaining payment to a check balance /transfer which was just taken out. When I asked why didn't they apply the amount to the oldest transfer balance ( since this amount will start to accrue interest on XX/XX/XXXX ) they indicated that they can apply it to any amount they want.. In my case they applied the remaining payment to the balance transfer/promotional check with the lasted date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) where the balance will start to accrue on XX/XX/XXXX. The remedy which I am looking from Barclay is for them to apply the payment made on the account in a manner which is proper and fair. Payment which be applied in their entirety to the balances with the highest interest rates thereby allowing a fair and equitable reduction on balances with the highest rates. Furthermore, if appropriate then a payment should be allocated to the balances with the earliest coming promotional dates. Barclay should not be allowed to take advantage of consumers. Furthermore, clear and plain disclosure of this practice and not made. Documentation can be submitted upon request.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, there were 4 fraudulent transactions of {$1100.00} on my credit card ending # XXXX. Bank of America detected these transactions and sent me a phone message to verify is this was me. I said no, and immediately contacted them to cancel the card and open the investigation. XX/XX/XXXX. I received notice in my Desktop app of Bank of America, stating I responsible for all four transactions, as follows Our records indicate that the card was present at the time of the transaction ( s ) as the chip on your card was read. In addition, your PIN may have been entered or a signature obtained. As a result, youll be responsible for the balance on the account in accordance with your Account agreement. Since Desktop app way was the only was I was notified ( no email or mail ), I noticed this message by end of XXXX. Bank of America provided no further evidence for the statements above. XX/XX/XXXX. I personally go to Bank of America, with a document written, asking them to re-open the case, and provide me the following : 1. The exact timing of transactions ( made with credit card ending # XXXX ) between period XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Apparently these were in-store transactions which I have never authorized. What is more significant, credit card was with me all the time. Thus, I asked for this information because I could possibly prove that I was not present during these transactions. 2. Proof that my chip card was read, in addition to the proof that either PIN was used or my signature ( with signature scan ) 3. List of all transactions attempted with credit card ending # XXXX in the past two years, that is between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This was related to two things - a ) I suspected that there could be more fraudulent transaction attempts, which are not visible to me as an end-customer of BoA, b ) I havent been using the card ending # XXXX, ever since I opened another reward card for better in-store deals ( that is in past two years ). XX/XX/XXXX. I got mail from BoA, stating, \" We've received your dispute regarding our decision on the fraud claim. Our decision hasn't changed '' Bank of America provided me no evidence about their investigation that I have asked for, I was found responsible for transactions even though I stated I haven't done it in via messaging system, and their communication with me was done very poorly and scarcely.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Citi Cards Account Number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have attempted to resolve the debt with Citi Cards since XXXX. Please see previous case numbers XXXX and XXXX. The initial debt was with Citi Cards. I failed to make payments due to unemployment, and the account was transferred to XXXX XXXX. Prior to the account being transferred to XXXX Once, I attempted to contact Citi Cards to resolve a modified payment arrangement due to my employment status. A representative, XXXX, instructed me there was no record of my account. The account was transferred to a third party. He provided the account would be transferred back to Citi Cards after the account was brought current. I contacted XXXX XXXX and provided payment in the sum of XXXX to bring the account current. The next payment was not due until the XXXX. A representative, XXXX, contacted me prior to the XXXX and attempted to collect additional monies. I instated I would not make another payment until the due date. XXXX incited to begin using derogatory remarks and comments related to my refusal to pay the debt. I terminated the phone call and contacted Citi Cards to report the incident. A representative from Citi Cards provided they were not able to provide any plan of action based on the remarks of the representative from XXXX XXXX. I provided information to the representative related to my payment to bring the account current. The representative provided the account was still being held by XXXX XXXX. Citi Cards was unable to resolve the issue of harassment ; therefore, I filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). The incident report numbers for Citi Cards and XXXX XXXX are detailed above. I contacted XXXX XXXX on the XXXX to provide the next payment. I was told the party assigned to my account was out sick. A phone call was returned, and the supervisor informed me the assigned representative was no longer employed with XXXX XXXX. He continued to share they received information related to my complaint to CFPB ), and they would no longer be able to work with me or accept payments. The supervisor provided the account was being transferred back to Citi Cards. Following, this conversation, I began to make payments online to Citi Cards. In XX/XX/XXXX, I included the account into debt consolidation as the account was current. I proceeded to make monthly payments. The balance has been reduced from over 5,000 to approximately XXXX. A copy of my credit report was retrieved to review the progress of the debt management program. I noted Citi Cards reported the account to all three credit bureaus as a charge off. I never received communication-related to the debt being transferred to a charge off account. This was unannounced to me pending the review of my credit report. Also, this was not indicative in XX/XX/XXXX when the account was entered into the debt consolidation program. The account was current as of XX/XX/XXXX, and it is being paid in full. The account was NOT settled for a lesser amount than what was owed. I have contacted Citi Cards approximately five times to resolve the issue of the reporting. The last call was on XXXX. A representative, XXXX, informed me the account was listed as a charge-off in XX/XX/XXXX. Citi Cards began to accept payments from the debt consolidation company in XX/XX/XXXX. Citi Cards incited this action, enlisting the account as a charge-off, after receiving initial contact from the debt management agency. I questioned why I didn't receive notification and expressed concern as the card was current. Payments were made through XXXX XXXX and online with Citi Cards. XXXX communicated he was unable to help me or reverse the charge off. The charge-off was unfairly reported on my credit report. I have attempted to resolve issues with payment and recording through Citi Cards related to this account since XXXX. Documentation can be noted in the complaint based though CFPB. Citi Cards has been unwilling to determine the following : why I did not receive communication about the status of the account being changed to charge-off ; why the account status was changed to a charge-off account after the account was brought current ; documentation of payments from XXXX XXXX, and rationale for unfair/inaccurate reporting to the three credit bureaus. The account was brought current in XXXX. Moreover, the account is being paying in full. The reporting of a charge-off has and will continue to have a negative impact on my credit score. In correspondence provided by Citi Cards on XXXX, they recognized the unprofessional behavior by the XXXX XXXX employee and resolved I would continue to make payments to XXXX XXXX until the account was paid in full. However, XXXX XXXX informed me they would no longer accept payments from my following my complaint to CFPB. XXXX XXXX instructed me to resume payment to Citi Cards. I resumed payments online. The discontinuity of communication between the creditor ( Citi Cards ) and debt collector ( XXXX XXXX ) has caused undue stress. In addition, the inconsistencies in receipt of payment possible contributed to errors in crediting payments to my account during the transitions of the account from Citi Cards to XXXX XXXX and back from XXXX to Citi Cards again. In turn, this contributed to inaccuracies being reported to the three credit bureaus. I have attempted for more than two years to rectify the error in reporting or changing the account to a charge-off status. The account was closed by the creditor while it was in current status. Also, the account is being paid in full. There was NO settlement agreement for the due amount.\n",

I assume the vacation club took my information from the papet and put it into a separate application. I have a charge of {$2200.00} on my card. like my husband stated, we did sign a membership contact which is now cancelled and this has nothing to do with us authorizing this vacation club to take money off of credit cards that we didnt know about. we NEVER signed a receipt or verbally authorize this vacation club to take money from these credit cards. There were no services or Supplies rendered. we also let the vacation club keep {$1000.00} dollars from our bank account during this cancellation. It would not be right for them to keep the {$2200.00} from my card and {$4500.00} from my husband 's card after illegally taking the money. The credit card company sided with vacation club after they showed them we signed a contract for a membership with them and failed to cancel during the 3 day cancellation policy. yes, we failed to cancel with them after being toyed around for a year with lies about not being able to cancel. at the end of the day, this vacation club contact has nothing to do with us authorizing this company to take {$6700.00} dollars from us without our consent.\n",

I called Synchrony Bank in XX/XX/2019 as I began receiving notices for an unpaid account which I did not authorize or establish ; Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was notified by your company on regarding an alleged debt for the above referenced account number. I have reason to believe I do not owe this debt because I have never established or authorized the account to be created. I am unfamiliar with the terms/conditions of this debt nor did I approve, authorize, sign or receive any information about this debt or the type of debt. I am unsure if this is a credit card or a loan? When I first inquired about this debt I was transferred to several individuals. I finally spoke to summon in the legal department with Synchrony Bank ; so I was told. I advised the individual that I had inquired about rates and information on loans with numerous vendors but did not sign or see any agreement for Synchrony Bank. The representative told me that the loan was taken out my XXXX technician and that if I wanted to see terms and conditions of the account I should contact my XXXX repair person. Needless to say, I was quite frustrated. I expected a much higher level of service from Synchrony Bank as I have other credit accounts that are administered through your institution.

I know nothing of the debt, why the debt exists or who authorized the debt to be established.

By the shear volume of these refinances and the money that was made, these banks exposed themselves to their shoddy workmanship and to remedy blamed the customers for their mistakes.

Customer paid {$380.00} for that credit report and is the responsibility of the lender to underwrite such disclosure? 2 ) Why did Wells Fargo not notify attorneys of borrower and defendant in their lawsuit against borrower that they dropped their frivolous lawsuit and sold the mortgage to XXXX XXXX as required by federal law? Wells Fargo is deliberately trying to confuse and deflect their liability, both civil and criminal, by delaying and reiterating their false narrative to the CFPB and the OCC.

I advised her that my small business is paperless ... of course I am growing more irritated as she had given me a 9 page BOF form to complete via handwriting. She was quite condescending, which lead to me being stern about the discrimination I was receiving. Next thing I know the branch manager came over to lecture me and tell me to lower my voice.

My wife and I qualify for {$3900.00} per month in social security starting in XX/XX/2020. There is absolutely no risk that we wont be able to make the payments on the loan. We have very low debt and great credit. In our past history of home ownership we have never missed or had a late payment.

I asked the court for the information in writing so that I can send it to the credit bureaus and be able to get that bankruptcy deleted. I received the letter in the mail, I sent it to all three credit bureaus and it seems like they ignored the letter and they keep telling me that the bankruptcy is accurate. I know that these companies get this information from another company called XXXX XXXX. The FCRA states that all information on a consumers credit report needs to be 100 % accurate. This bankruptcy is being reported inaccurate. This is a violation of the FCRA and it is breaking the law. I have included the letter from the Bankruptcy XXXX as proof.\n",

Only this time, the following morning, I was informed that the payment didn't go through. So naturally, I sent it through again. After checking the linked account I am paying the bill with, all of the charges displayed that they had been taken out. However, now I am out over 900 $ ( also included is an overdraft charge on the linked account used to pay the credit bill of XXXX $ ) Now USAA has over 900 $ of mine, hasn't returned my credit limit or my funds that they have TAKEN and has been cleared by my bank. I have no available credit, they will be charging me interest on the remaining balance and no access to funds because they overdrew my checking account at my other bank. Meanwhile, they said they have to hold MY money for 10 days. Whatever the reason, their system triggered this. They have stated there is nothing they can do, which I know is false. The credit limit I have is XXXX . And I have no explanation as to why this is even remotely acceptable. This is theft from a major corporation and there has been no attempt at resolving this.

They threaten to repossess if I do not pay whatever unreasonable amount they determine I owe. They refuse to provide me with detailed activity of my account and payoff amount. They claim that I will be sued or my property will be seized and even sent a man to my home with a large paper that resembled a legal document. They have added unauthorized interest, fees, and charges not listed in my contract. They call me repeatedly, almost daily, and cause undue stress on my family and I.

      "VALUE OF S is On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX about refinancing my mortgage. The first mortgage company to call me was AmeriSave. I started the processes with them. They lead me to believe that there offer would most likely be the best offer but told me they would beat any better offer I got by {$500.00} but it had to be a locked-in offer. To get there lock I had to give them a {$500.00} nonrefundable fee. They failed to tell me that no-one else I talked to would require this fee. Most of the other companies I talked to gave me better deals. I was told I had 3 days to shop the loan. On the third day, I sent the general loan information on the better offers to them and did not hear back for 2 days so I assumed they were not going to match and went with a different company. Turns out the loan officer was sick and never bothered to let me know. He had my text information and had previously sent me a message. He knew I believed I only had 3 days yet never bothered to let me know he was out. I sent them an e-mail letting them know I had picked someone else and did not get a message back until 2 days later. I talked to the Texas division manager a few days before my closing to get my {$500.00} back. They told me that because I had not close I could still break my agreement with the other company and they would still beat it. I told him I would not go back on my word. The loan officer kept telling me how honest he was but failed to tell me that most other companies would not ask for a refundable deposit. He said he knew for sure that XXXX also did that. If they truly believed that most other companies would require a fee to lock in my rate and they would only match locked-in rates than that 500 $ was a way to force me to go with them. I got a better offer from everyone else I talked to and everyone else also told me that would beat any other offer. If everyone else can do that I see no justification for that charge and would like it back.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/XXXX I returned from a vacation to find a collection bill in my mailbox. I was shocked because I did not know about this outstanding bill. When I called the collection agency on XX/XX/XXXX, I found out that the bill was from service that was performed on XX/XX/XXXX. This was an XXXX that I had for treatment of my XXXX XXXX. My physician had obtained a prior authorization prior to beginning the XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. During the conversation with the collection agency, the representative stated that he could see that I was not billed for the date of service except right after the service was completed in XX/XX/XXXX before it was billed to the insurance. The representative stated he could not see any additional bills being sent to me. As I continued to investigate, I found that the last denial from the insurance company was done on XX/XX/XXXX. The collection agency admitted that they had received the file from XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX but did not send anything to me until the end of XX/XX/XXXX. The issues that I have with this is that I had prior authorization giving us the approval to have the infusions completed. The insurance denial on XX/XX/XXXX showed that the billing department did not include the authorization number and on XX/XX/XXXX the denial stated not deemed medical necessity yet I received prior authorization stating it was approved. The facility failed to bill the insurance with the necessary documentation allowing it to be paid in full. Because the collection agency sat on the bill for the 180-day parking time it took away my ability to appeal the claim with the insurance company and get the bill paid. Additionally, if there were any uncovered costs the facility was to bill it to the pharmaceutical company who would have picked up any uncovered costs but because of the failure to bill the insurance company the pharmaceutical company was unable to pay the uncovered costs as well. I am including with this letter the documents showing the approval prior authorization letter, the denial letters from the insurance company, additional EOBs showing different dates of services for the same infusion showing payment and information on XXXX XXXX from the pharmaceutical company. I do not feel that we should have to pay this bill since it was an error on the facilities part in billing it to the insurance correctly as well as their delay in notifying me prevented me from being able to appeal it and get the services covered by the insurance. Also as soon as I contacted the Collection company they immediately placed it on my credit as a derogatory claim going back to the time that they received the claim in XX/XX/XXXX. Any help you can give me to get this claim off my credit and preventing the facility from pursuing this further would be appreciated.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Hello, Today 's date is XX/XX/19 I have a First National Bank ( FNB ) of Omaha Orvis Credit with a {$3000.00} credit limit, which is paid off monthly. FNB allowed a transaction to be posted against my credit card which allowed my credit limit to be exceed. I have NOT opted in to over-limit fees so the expectation that any transaction is declined if there isn't enough available credit to cover it. I have contacted FNB and their representatives indicated have no hard stop of purchases that exceed credit limits as they find their card holders to be upset and they do not wish to have to communicate with them, so they allow over limit purchases. I asked if I could have a hard limit set on my account and they said no, they can not do that. I have contacted two ( 2 ) out of three ( 3 ) credit bureaus and they said that FNB should provide a later to sort this indicating FNB 's misstep. When this was communicated to FNB, they said no, they will not. At this point, given the above I have to accept what appears to be a business practice of FNB that is in direct conflict with the \" Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act '' which indicates that over limit purchases should be declined.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I tried to freeze my credit today, XX/XX/XXXX with Experian and their online tool says they are unable to perform this action based on the information I have given, which is everything they ask for. I then tried to call them directly to perform this action over the phone and all they have available is an automated system that walks me through the same information collection and then tells me that I will need to mail in a request. The online tool also demands that I mail in a request. The information they request to be mailed in is everything a potential criminal would need to assume my identity. The address I must send the information to clearly states that it is going to the credit freeze department of Experian which means that any savvy criminal could intercept this letter and use the included information to assume my identity and wreak havoc on my life. Per the ruling of XX/XX/XXXX I have the right to freeze my credit for free. XXXX and XXXX make this possible via online and phone. Experian is clearly trying to avoid people freezing their credit and working with consumers by making the credit freeze pathway too onerous/difficult. Their online and phone pathways are nothing more than a gesture to fulfill a government requirement and do not actually provide a safe path for protecting one 's credit and therefore Experian is in violation of the law. Experian should be forced to provide a safe online or phone pathway to freeze one 's credit just as XXXX and XXXX provide.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Hurricane Irma in 2017 had major impact on my income and did damage to my house. I inquired about the forebearance option. The way it was presented to me was that since I could not afford the current payment they would suspend payments until the work to fix my house was completed. They gave me two options for once the work was completed ; I could either pay ( make current ) the payments that were not made during the suspension or they could remodify the loan. I specifically asked about the modification due to the fact that my income potential was drastically reduced ( due to Hurricane ). My question was to the point ... the only modification to the loan would be the length ... if loan is suspended for say 3 months then the loan maturity date gets extended by the same. Their answer was yes. It took 9 months to get insurance company to correctly payout and get work completed, so there were no mortgage payments made for those 9 months. Once completed Loan Depot sent me a trial modification program to get the process started. I was told that the higher payments were to assist in getting the escrow balances back on track, I made all the payments ( on time ). Then came the loan modification itself, documents came along with foreclosure, short sale and deed-in-lieu documents. This scared me to death so I signed the new loan. My payments went from roughly $ XXXX/month to $ XXXX/month due to an additional {$18000.00} being added to the loan. They said it was for the unpaid months during forebearance. I called several times trying to get clarification but got the run-around each time. Not sure how it works ... loan payments were suspended ... yet they are charging me for them as if they made them for me. Again I go back to my question prior to accepting the forebearance program, trust me if I had any inclination that they would added that money to the loan I would have never done the program. They also talked on fees ( not sure for what ) and reported me to the credit bureaus as late over 120 days ... which they promised me they would not do. I feel as if I was scammed, the program is to assist people in times of trouble and because of it I have an even bigger problem now. If I was going to have difficulty paying {$1700.00} a month ... how can I afford {$2100.00}\n",

      "VALUE OF S is A while back I lost my wallet with all my personal information inside. I didn't think much of it and just went to get a new social security and DL. I continued with my everyday life and never had an issue. Just a couple of days ago I decided to pull my credit because I continued to get suspicious letters in the mail. I looked at my report and I am shocked with the number of items that were opened on my name. These suspicious items are not mine. Please remove them from my report.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Just a suggestion - I did write this with breaks between paragraphs, making it easier to read, but they seem to have been removed from the final edit. Hello, I am filing a separate complaint against XXXX with the Comptroller of the Treasury, so I am not going to go into the details of how this began ( unless you request that I do, in which case I'll be happy to ). What this filing is about is Experian not correcting information that they can see with their own eyes is erroneous. A couple of months ago - possibly closer to three - I filed a dispute against XXXX with Experian regarding an error on my credit report. ( I have not yet seen whether this also appears on XXXX or XXXX reports, but I will find that out shortly ). While XXXX is the culprit for not reporting over {$3000.00} in payments they've received from me in the last year and a half, Experian is complicit in refusing to recognize a blatant mathematical impossibility. I have received no correspondence whatsoever related to the results of the dispute, not from Experian nor the creditor. I see nothing on the report that shows that any change has been made - no comments, no anything ( I've asked them to direct me to where that is if I'm simply looking in the wrong place, but they have offered no help whatsoever in that regard ). Over the past year and a half I have sent XXXX {$150.00} a month ( this figure is the result of a payment agreement I came to with XXXX that they chose to remove me from, but that I nevertheless stayed true to ). These payments have cleared the bank and have been applied to the balance. Yet the report is showing that no payments have been made for the past 20 months! I noticed when about to submit this that it says I will not be able amend it later with any documentation. While I'm not prepared to do that at the moment, it really isn't necessary to provide proof of the payments because on the very same report, it shows that the balance has gone down by the total of the payments ( and it will have reduced even further by the time you get to this, as another payment just went out ). Yet XXXX refuses to acknowledge this and has even written off the balance as a bad debt ( I'm assuming that's what \" charge-off '' means ). Both things can't be true - that XXXX has not been receiving payments AND that the balance is being reduced. I know with certainty my credit score is suffering from this. Just last week Experian itself sent me an alert that I dropped from the \" good '' to \" fair '' range, even citing the XXXX issue as the reason! From here on in, if XXXX would like the reality to be that it's a bad debt that is not being paid down so they can write if off, then they should decline the payments. Or I will oblige them by stopping the payments, but I must hear that from them first. As an aside, I am unable to access any of this through XXXX. They no longer send me statements and from what I can tell, have removed me from their customer database altogether - there is no account for me to log in to. This is also something that needs to be changed, so that I can keep a closer eye on things. It's no secret that the bureaus receive most of their revenue from the creditors - how the government allows such a conflict of interest to go on is mind-boggling. Apologies for lack of brevity. Thanks for your time, XXXX XXXX\n",

      "VALUE OF S is To whom it may concern, this will be the 3rd complaint submitted on this file. The client recently filed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy and since the bankruptcy has been filed, we received information that is concerning to not only the client but the bankruptcy court as well. Complaints were filed with the CFPB on XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019 regarding a discrepancy of the number of modifications the client has already received. The lender was claiming three modifications were received by the client but could not produce any documentation confirming these modifications even existed. A complaint was filed to ensure the CFPB would step in demanding copies of the three modifications the lender stated she received however that was never done. The reason the amount of modifications received was in dispute is because per the client she only received 1 for the life of this loan and in the pooling and service agreement she is entitled to more than one. Per CFPB guidelines the lender needs to exhaust any and all loss mitigation options that would allow the client to keep her home if there is a valid hardship in which there was and still is. Instead of the lender helping her they wanted to increase her monthly mortgage payments to over 51 % of her net income which is clearly not affordable and would cause her to lose her home. That is not a modification by any means. Also, by stating she has had multiple modifications it created a bias with the investors as they were under the impression, she had three already. Per the answers from the complaint filed on XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019 the lender admitted to providing incorrect information and stated the client has only had two modifications. That letter will be attached for your review. The concern at this time is after speaking with the bankruptcy attorney for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX about this issue she requested copies of any and all modifications on the file and the lender confirmed with their attorneys that there has only been one modification given to the client XXXX XXXX since the loan was taken out which again contradicts what the lender is stating and it seems as though the lender has given nothing but false statements to not only the client but the CFPB as well. This is not only outrageous but extremely unfair and against the guidelines of the investor who should be required to assist us with this matter as the lender is solely their responsibility. The investor and the lender should be held fully liable and accountable for the false statements and false information given which not only could cost this client her home but also effected the bankruptcy proceeding as well.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I have been a loyal customer and account holder with Wells Fargo for about 5 years now. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a {$10000.00} secured credit card with them so they took a {$10000.00} collateral from my checking account. Since the day I opened this credit card account, I had paid on time and never missed a payment to this day. I never overcharged the card or went above the limit. In fact, over the past year I never really used the card for more than {$500.00} a month which I would pay in full at the end of each month. Finally, after 3 years, Wells Fargo decided to release the collateral and change the credit card account to an unsecured credit card. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from them stating that they would be depositing the collateral amount ( {$10000.00} ) into my checking account by XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, that's not what happened. I did not receive my collateral by XX/XX/XXXX and they made me run after my money for three weeks for different excuses. Once, the check was lost in mail, another time one of the managers had forgotten to sign the check, and another time they had realized that not been able to deposit the collateral into my checking amount for some mysterious reason. I finally received the check 10 days late and after more than a dozen phone calls and follow ups. Furthermore, Mid-XXXX, after my credit card had changed to an unsecured card, I received a letter from the Executive Office of Wells Fargo, stating that \" to manage their risk '' they've decided to close my account. I then, called every single department I could speak to, including the Executive Office, but they did not provide me any proper reason to why they closed an account with perfect payment history, no late payments, no high utilization and etc. I Spoke with probably more than 20 representatives and spent more than 24 hours on the phone with them to get an answer, but I wasn't successful. I spend 4 years building history and a perfect relationship with Wells Fargo and had {$10000.00} of my hard earned money sitting with them as collateral to make sure that I built history on my credit report and all of a sudden they closed my account for no good reason. This is clearly a discriminatory act by Wells Fargo since I am from the XXXX. I have been a victim of discrimination by this financial institution and want others like myself to be aware of what they did to me. I dont want this to happen to any other lawful XXXX XXXX like myself who work hard in this country and pay taxes like any citizen.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My XXXX XXXX credit card was closed when I applied and received another card from Barclays, most likely due to different addresses. I have never missed a payment, my credit was excellent. My complaint letter to Office of the President was answered by an employee who put me on hold, then hung up and never answered any other calls. I wrote a letter to Barclays to challenge the closing, and received a letter back stating that they could not reopen my account and told me to apply for another card. When I applied I was denied, by another letter stating I had not paid or filed bankruptcy which was completely untrue. Again, there is no number to call. The company has the worst customer service I have ever encountered.

This is impacting my ability to have a FICO score that reflects who I am : a law abiding citizen who responsibly takes care of her debt and financial responsibilities. It is negatively impacting my ability to receive the best interests rates on loans and therefore this gross negligent behavior from Grant and Weber is having a negative impact on my economic status and potential as a consumer.

They have admitted their error and said it would not be fixed until Monday XX/XX/2019.

      "VALUE OF S is Hi! I enrolled in Best Buys credit card through Citibank XX/XX/XXXX to buy new appliances for our home.

We paid the majority of this within the first year in a lump sum. They ran a 2 year promotion of interest free and when XX/XX/XXXX hit there was {$2400.00} on my account for an interest charge. Before this and after this, I received XXXX cutesy notification that the promo was expiring or that this would be what would be hitting my account. I recently received ( 1 week ) calls from their call team trying to collect money that now the balance is {$3900.00} within 1 month. I called and tried to talk to multiple supervisors and they told me there's nothing they can do. I offered to pay the remaining balance right away and for an interest charge of the remaining balance. Instead they said there's nothing they can do and I had to pay a 3x of what my outstanding actually is. They had XXXX cooperation and very little customer help. Again, we are frequent shoppers and have perfect standing with credit and the majority was paid. This promo charge is ridiculous considering what the balance left and Citibank is a complete scam with their lack of communication or heads up to their customers of anything changing. They only called to collect after that large interest charge was put on the bottom line. I will no longer be affiliated with either companies. This is a major disappointment across the board.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I received several phone calls from a debt collector under the name of JPL Group, claiming that my debt of XXXX in principal with the company XXXX XXXX had been transferred to their company for collection. The voicemails threatened lawsuit action and left various different contact numbers. After several missed calls, I answered a call from JPL on XX/XX/XXXX. A woman named XXXX XXXX informed me of the above-mentioned debt. She said that if I did not pay the debt in full over the phone, they would serve me with court papers and court date, claiming I would need to defend my case in court. I told her that I would need to verify the debt as legitimate before I would give her company any money and asked her for contact information. She provided me with this information : JPL Group jplgroupsolutions.com XXXX XXXX - Civil Processing Division Collecting debts on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX ext. XXXX Business Hours XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX Loan received : XX/XX/XXXX Principal Balance : {$500.00} I requested copies of my bank statements for the entire 2012 year, and I found no deposit made from ANY loan company. Next, I called XXXX XXXX and provided them with my personal information. The customer service ran my information through the XXXX XXXX database and no record of any loan. He then passed my information along to his manager who ran my information through the company 's extensive database. Again, there is no record of loan issued in my name at any date or time. XXXX XXXX filed a complaint in regard to this fraudulent matter and asked that I also file a complaint as an individual to aid in the prevention of further fraudulent debt collection attempts by the company JPL Group.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/2020 the XXXX dollar annual fee for my CitiBank XXXX XXXX Platinum Select Card post to my account. On XXXX XXXX I contacted Citibank 's Consumer Credit Division to ask if it was too late to cancel the card and have the annual fee refund. The Citi representative replied that it was not too late to have the annual fee refunded if I canceled the card, as Citi would refund an annual fee as long as the card was canceled within 60 days of the fee posting. Given that information, I asked and was approved to close my Citibank XXXX Platinum Select on XX/XX/XXXX. When I noticed that the annual fee had not been removed from my account the following day, I again called Citibank and was informed on XX/XX/2020 by another representative that the fee would be removed as I had cancelled within Citi 's 60 day refund window. I assumed the matter was closed and did not monitor the account further. On XX/XX/2020 I received an email, noting that I had a XXXX dollar past due payment on my Citibank XXXX Platinum Select Credit Card. After verifying that the fee was in fact still on my account, I attempted to contact Customer Service with seven separate calls. I was placed on hold for more than two hours for two of the first six calls. For four of the first six calls, the automated system ended my call during my wait period with no explanation. I was finally about to speak to a Citi customer service representative on my seventh attempt. The representative informed me that she could not remove the annual fee from my account, as Citi had recently changed its annual fee refund policy, saying that while it had previously been 60 days from the fee posting it was now 37 days. I pointed out to the representative that was not what I had been told when I cancelled the card, and noted that if I had known I would need to pay the annual fee regardless, I would have at least chosen to keep the card for the additional year to take advantage of the benefits. I also pointed out to the representative that no where in Citi 's Card Member Agreement do they define a specific timeline for how long a client has to request a refund after an annual fee posts to their account. I also pointed out that I had never received any notification regarding Citi 's refund policy change. Most importantly I felt it was completely unjust that I am expected to pay an annual fee for benefits I will not be able to use, as I had already cancelled the card based on different advice.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I XXXX makes a claim with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) that the following attached attempt to collect a debt is highly fraudulent. My personal information is being floated in what is known in the debt collection business as a \" Debt Pool '', whereas collection information is outdated and not even enforceable. The attached collection from Midwest Recovery Systems does not state that the debt is no longer enforceable, a stipulation by the Federal Trade Commission. The method of an illegal posting of a collection on my personal credit report, or an illegal collection against my rights of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act can not be tolerated. In Federal Trade Commission v. XXXX ( XX/XX/2009 ) the federal district court decided in favor of the Federal Trade Commission that a collection agency must operate within strict guidelines in the collection of a debt. The criteria are as follows : 1 ) The debt must still be enforceable within the state of procurement or where the original obligator resides, or a combination of both. 2 ) The debt collector must be licensed and bonded if applicable within the state in which it is trying to collect, if the debt is collectable. 3 ) The validation of debt ownership must be proved, without exception. There is no statement on the attached collection that the debt is no longer enforceable. The collection agency stipulates that XXXX obtained a judgment against me. By legal mandate, the docket number of the judgment must be listed as well as what county clerk 's office the judgment is filed with. In this case, there is no judgment. The statement saying \" This judgment may be forwarded to an attorney for execution '' is a complete falsehood. There can not be a lawsuit as the legal time limit to enforce a summary judgment action has passed. Even though the collection letter states that illegal, abusive, deceptive and unfair debt collections are illegal, this collection in its entirety is just that, a deceptive illegal attempt to collect a debt that is no longer enforceable. I demand that all my information be purged immediately by Midwest Recovery Systems and XXXX, and that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) take the necessary steps to sanction both companies for using such abusive collection tactics.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Around XXXX of 2013, When i was pregnant and still a tourist in this country a doctors office that was supposed to do a ultrasound on my belly. My husband at the time was the financial responsible for everything and yet i still got charged hundreds of dollars for something not executed. Fast forward, 7 years later im sill being accused to own {$710.00} for that clinic. The collector refused to provide me the proof of the paperwork for that XXXX XXXX and failured to pursuit my ex husband and as in today i noticed my credit report got affected with that {$710.00} 7years old ultrasound. I lost 46 points and it feels like after 7years they should not be harassing me anymore. Im trying to find a way to report this collector/ clinic\n",

That wasnt bad. I called back and the representative asked for my social security number in order to confirm my application which I did give him. He asked for my bank routing number since it was going to be a direct deposit loan. I actually did give him that. Then, he said that he would need my bank account login information ( username and password ) in order to get into my account. I was polite in refusing to yield to his request. He became rude and the tone of his voice increased, threatening that he wont give me the loan and I shouldnt call him back. Well, maam, {$8000.00} is a lot of money and I cant deposit it into your account without logging into your bank account, he said. I told him again politely that my login information should be my private thing. He told me not to call him again until Im ready to give him the information he needs. Call back tomorrow when you really need the money, he said and then ended the call. I was shocked and wondered how unprofessional this company was and decided to call again in order to ask if there were other options for me to get the loan. He picked up and said maam, if youre not ready to give me the login information, dont call this number again. He did hang up again for the second time. Few minutes later, I decided to call again and the company refused to answer. I called two more times. No answer. I came to a conclusion that XXXX XXXX XXXX is either a scam or it has a horrible customer service. Im still shocked. Also, this business is not same as PROSPER MARKETPLACE INC ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) because I called PROSPER MARKETPLACE INC and was able to confirm the differences.\n",

I disputed this fraudulent debt with XXXX XXXX and Ability Recovery Services, only to be provided with documents purporting that I signed up. However, I filed all the required and necessary affidavit and reports to show that this is and was a fraudulent account. Nevertheless, XXXX XXXX is still, by and through ability, attempting to collect on this fraudulent debt. Moreover, they are using a company that is not registered in the State of Michigan as required. Ability Recovery Services , LLC ( a Pennsylvania LLC ), doing business in Michigan, is attempting to collect on an alleged debt, which I have clearly stated is a fraudulent debt. Ability, through the XXXX in PA, sent me multiple documents from XXXX XXXX to validate the debt, but, as I stated, it is not my debt and I have filled out all the required paperwork, affidavits and reports. They are also reporting the fraudulent debt to my credit reports, which has caused my score to drop.

I am not saying that they need to be a licensed collection agency, but they do need to be registered with the state in order to transact business here, and they have not. Their website clearly states that they collect in all 50 states, and further claim that they are bonded and insured nationwide. They have never filed for an Application for Certificate of Authority to Transact Business in Michigan, they have no Registered Agent in Michigan, and yet they continue to flaunt the laws of this state and the State of Pennsylvania. Their illegal business practices need to be investigated at once, so more Michiganders are not put in the situation of dealing with such an unscrupulous company, who willingly, willfully and knowingly violates numerous Federal and State Statutes.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I bought a car on XX/XX/2019 just over 2 weeks ago with {$1000.00} down and {$500.00} deferred. They did not disclose that there was a GPS tracking/disabling device on the vehicle. They started out telling to just get my insurance as soon as possible then the very first Tuesday or Wednesday they already disabled the vehicle saying that I was supposed to have my insurance within 24 hours, if I would have known it was 24 hours I would not have tried to wait until payday on the following Friday, I would have done my insurance immediately. Then come Saturday the XX/XX/XXXX they have disabled my car again because I paid {$300.00} of the {$500.00} deferred amount that was due that day. Then I lost a contact that couldnt be replaced over the weekend because ai did not even have access to my prescription over the weekend. I did not order glasses at the time because XXXX XXXX could not connect with my government XXXX/XXXX XXXX and were trying to charge me too much money. Anyway when I paid the {$300.00} one of the sales people at Texas Auto Center assisted me in making the {$300.00} payment in their payment ATM and I said I would pay the rest as soon as I made it with XXXX and XXXX, he did not argue or say anything at the time. Then Monday morning at the optometrist they start harassing phone calls and disabled the vehicle. The period of time the {$200.00} was late and the disabling of my vehicle is absolutely ridiculous and the harassing phone calls starting the very next business day is very extreme! Texas Auto Center in XXXX XXXX, TX needs to extend that period of time before they start harassing their customers and disabling their vehicle to allow for a more fair period of time and give honest customers a chance to make things right. They constantly lie and give their customers the run around. I have been reading their customer complaints and reviews on the XXXX XXXX XXXX website and have since come to the conclusion that their business practices are highly shady and their consumers need protection from these sharks that most of them do not know where to solicit.\n",

XXXX XXXX XXXX is running a huge scam that is being pushed by national banks to offset losses on their quarterly 10Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, I need both of these collections rescinded immediately unless transfer from a securitized trust can be proved.

This is the year I left my marriage and started banking with a new bank. I looked at the charges and didn't recognize them. Some of the charges were in a different state than I lived in. I called to advise them of this and they said they would open and investigation. I waited about 2 months and didn't hear anything back so I called again. They advised no investigation was ever started. They put me on hold for 45 minutes as they were \" looking into it '' then hung up on me. I called back. They advised that they could see an investigation had been started and I would hear from someone. I asked how I would hear from them and they couldn't answer. I had to force them to take my new contact information. I waited 2 more months and again heard nothing. I called back again but this time to the corporate office. They listened to my complaints about nothing ever happening. Assured me an investigation would happen and that they would personally call me back. They confirmed the address that the address was opened in and I advised that was NOT my address at the time. They also said that my name was the only name on the account. I never received a call back but I did receive a letter and a check for {$270.00} for all of my trouble. I was advised that it had been removed off of my report. I thought it was done. A couple of weeks later I received a letter stating that my report was denied and they found it to be my debt. I called and told them I wanted proof and they told me they couldn't provide me with proof that they didn't have to and that they were going to put it back on my credit report. I contacted the corporate office again and complained. Again they assured me that the case manager would reopen the investigation and that she would personally call me back. They told me to wait until XX/XX/XXXX and if I hadn't heard from her to call her directly. I have called her several times and she will not return my call. I received a letter from her stating the debt is mine only this time they sent completely different invoices before and this time they have my then underage daughters name on the account as well. I have called multiple times to ask someone about the discrepancies and they refuse to call me back or provide legitimate proof that this debt is mine. I am fully aware that Wells Fargo was in a lot of trouble for their employees opening credit accounts in customers names without their permission.

      "VALUE OF S is I XXXX XXXX have made several requests for proof that a creditor once originated with a national financial institution that has FDIC insurance can sell off a debt that is part of a securitized trust. Then these same debt buyers that used to be known as collection agencies could re-assign the debt to a fourth party for collection enforcement. This process of stating that debts are being purchased by a third party and then enforced by a fourth party is the larges scam in America. The U. S. Supreme Court decision in XX/XX/2017 known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is responsible for this scam. This decision basically states that since a third party purchases the debt, that my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is VOID. The problem is that almost all unsecured debts are sold off to XXXX XXXX in various traunces in securitized trusts. There simply is no resolution where the debt can be purchased, only that the debt can be assigned for collection purposes. Each financial institution must file a 10Q filing quarterly with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The rules on debts being charged off is with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through the FDIC Act, Code 5000. A debt can be classified either standard or sub-standard. Debts over 180 days late must go into the sub-standard category and written off on a quarterly 10Q SEC filing. These charge 0ffs usually are submitted in the tens of millions of dollars. So its virtually for these debts to be sold..period. Accordingly, I request full validation proving the debt purchase.

Now Experian states as of XX/XX/XXXX there was no data to be reported but XXXX stated there was 120 days late reported on my report. Now between these two reporting agencies there is a mix of information but nothing correct. XXXX wrote back removing that account because they could not verify the account but the other two stated it was verified. I wrote XXXX XXXX about this matter and ask them to provide proof of said account. Well the time they said has come and go and I also wrote them another letter with no response. The more I piece this all together is that Experian and XXXX did not verify the account as they claim. I demand to see Verifiable proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my signature on it ) you have on file of the account in question.

The federal reserve system ( fractional illegal banking ) most Americans have no idea how our banking system works let alone the federal Reserve. It literally is the greatest ponzi scheme in history. Its completely unconstitutional and has created a disportion of wealth where the majority are slaves to banks. No where in our constitution does it state an independent banking system issuing these federal reserve notes that are now practical worthless has any authority, nor use our federal taxes as collateral against these loans. Then the big banks have devised perfect system that manipulate money and creates it out of thin air through credit. Its pathetic. Its made the rich richer and the poor poorer.

XXXX followed tax law and im asking XXXX and Transunion to follow suit and do what united state federal tax law tells one to do in the following situation. Im asking every single one of my creditors to follow the United States tax law with regards to debt. I want every single one of my creditors who wrote off my debt as a loss on their tax returns and recouped their money to remove that debt from XXXX and Transunion. The Federal tax law states \" Attempting to collect such monies, fees, etc. for an unsecured debt that has been claimed on federal taxes as a loss, and sold to another company for compensation constitutes fraud in any of the 50 states. '' It makes sense and all my creditors didnt hide they wrote it off. I want these collection companies who have no legal claim to this debt that again has been written off removed from my credit report and in reality they themselves are commiting tax fraud by trying to collect on these debts that no longer belong to me off my credit report. This is the law. Its not enforced but it should be. Big banks have lawyers who know tax law and get their clients to pay little to no taxes. XXXX followed the law and removed these items from my ctedit report. Since its the law I expect transunion and XXXX to do the same or they to are commiting fraud.\n",

XXXX, a company with no listed phone number, no website and a single publicly disclosed employee has accumulated 46 properties in Philadelphia through foreclosure proceedings. It has flipped about 10 of those properties. In one instance, XXXX foreclosed on XXXX XXXX XXXX, a newly built townhouse in a middle-class neighborhood of Philadelphia, for just {$65000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, two months after it had picked up the mortgage at a DASP sale. Another two months later, having made no major improvements to the property, XXXX resold the same house for {$170000.00}. These are in the minority of properties, however. In the majority of cases, private equity firms appear to mainly sit on the properties they accumulate, sometimes for years. If DASP buyers are renting out their new assets while they wait for home values to appreciate, many do not appear to be doing so legally : Out of dozens of properties owned by XXXX analyzed by City & State, none had received a rental license. City & State reached out to both HUD and RoundPoint for comment on multiple occasions, but received no reply from either entity. XXXX councilmember XXXX said she believed this process is increasing the number of vacant and rental properties in urban neighborhoods, in addition to other stressors. When you have homeowners who are evicted or who lose their homes, that has dramatic consequences for a city like ours that already struggles with poverty, she said. We have affordable housing waitlists that take years and homeless shelters that are overcrowded. We cant fix it all. It doesnt have to be this way. XXXX is part of Local Progress, a network of local elected officials that has pushed for reforms to programs like DASP. In XXXX, HUD announced that it would make an effort to steer more distressed mortgages to nonprofit buyers, who would ideally be more forgiving towards impoverished homeowners. Nonprofit mortgage buyers, known as community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, were previously outbid on 98 percent of DASP sales. Most recently Roundpoint violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act because it falsely represented XXXX debts in the mortgage billing statements, it threatened foreclosure, it disclosed information regarding the debt to credit reporting agencies, it used an agent to falsely communicate the loans status and then used deception to collect it, and italong with XXXXfalsely represented the legal character of the loan by representing that it could enforce it against XXXX ; ( 4 ) Roundpoint violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act by not substantively responding to XXXX notice of errors ; ( 5 ) Roundpoint violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act because of its false claims regarding owed amounts, required fees, loan enforcement, foreclosure, and credit ; and ( 6 ) Roundpoint violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by divulging incomplete or inaccurate information pertaining to a loan\n",

I was then told that as long as the partial payment of {$190.00} was paid my XX/XX/19 then the account would be in good standings. I advised that I would make my payment online on that day. Last week, I received another call from the collections department in regards to my loan. I repeated the same information to this representative that I stated to the last. Making them aware that I will keep my promise to pay by Monday XX/XX/2019. Again stating that the payment would be made online. Today I attempted to go online to make my payment only to find that my account information is no longer available and I am unable to make my payment as I had previously promised. I called in and spoke with 5 different representatives. The first two representatives hung up on me because they became frustrated and was unable to answer my questions. The 3rd representative transferred my over the online team which then transferred me back to customer service where I spoke to a 4th representative. Which then attempted to assist me and then the line was disconnected again. I called back and requested for a supervisor. I was then connected to a front line manager named XXXX ID # XXXX. I was told that I do not have access to the online and can't make payment for 6 months due the reverse payment. I attempted to make a payment via a 3rd party vendors which is a payment options that is available to me to make payment with a lower fee, however this option via XXXX and also via XXXX XXXX. Both are considered to be an acceptable payment option for this company. However, I have been blocked from making payment via the 3rd party vendors by Ally financial which they have on their website as payment options that can be done online or over the phone. The only option that I was given was the more expensive option of XXXX. XXXX and XXXX XXXX offer a fee of less than {$5.00} to submit a payment to Ally financial online. XXXX charges {$20.00} processing fee to send funds to Ally Auto. So currently I have not access to view my account details, statements, previous payments, nor do I have access to view my account in order to make the payment and ensure that it's applied to the correct account. I was told my XXXX that my account will be escalated and someone will get back with me in 24 hours. My account will be reported to the credit bureau tomorrow, which will cause a negative score on my credit as Ally Auto will report my account being passed due for 30 days due to this partial payment.

Furthermore, since the loan was connected to a proven fraudulent student loan history that is massive known fraudulent signatories and a wrong university I never attended, I requested that the loan be removed from all credit reports and not re-posted. Additionally, TransUnion re-posted a phone number that was disconnected more than 3 years ago after removing it and informing me by letter that no phone numbers would be put on my credit report. I asked all credit reporting agencies to not post any phone numbers to my credit reports since I change the number frequently, sometimes 4 times in a month.

      "VALUE OF S is In 2014 I went to Wells Fargo at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas with my mother to get a small student loan to cover the gap between my scholarship and my government aid. During the Loan application process the Wells Fargo associate told my mother and I that my loan would not accrue interest while I was in school, much like the federal subsidized loan I had just taken out. My mother has also confirmed that this associate explicitly told me that the contract I was signing meant that my loan would not accrue interest while I was in school. I was XXXX years old so I did not understand the terminology and signed the papers at the assurance of the associate. Five years later, I am looking at my Wells Fargo documents to check where I am with my loans in total, so I can anticipate the amount I need to payback upon graduation from law school. I notice that I have accrued almost double the amount of the loan in interest since it was signed in XXXX ( at an interest rate of almost 12 %, which absolutely should have been lowered as my credit score raised ) The Wells Fargo App only ever shows the principle interest and I had been led to believe that it was not accruing interest by the Wells Fargo associate so it was something I pushed to the back of my mind. There was no reason for me to believe that the loan was accruing interest between what the associate had assured me off as well as the principle balance being the only balance reflected on the Wells Fargo portal. I contacted Wells Fargo and they set me up with a customer service representative, Ms. XXXX XXXX at XXXX extension XXXX and she did nothing to help my situation. She reported back to me that the manager at the bank had \" no records '' of my student loan which is incredibly suspicious seeing as how Wells Fargo has had a problem as of the last few years of predatory loan practices. I told her that I was misled and lied to but she insisted it was my fault and I was informed because I signed the documents, again, I was XXXX years old and didn't know what 'interest ' really even meant. So I believed whatever the Wells Fargo Associate told me. I am not a XXXX person ... I have a credit score of over 750 and I am in law school -- what Wells Fargo did to me is wrong and I am worried for all of the other XXXX year olds out there who are being misled and LIED to by Wells Fargo in order to get them to sign loans and pile on the interest payments. Wells Fargo has told me there is 'nothing they can do about my situation ' but I know that that is also a lie. They are engaging in predatory behavior toward young and uninformed borrowers, and when I asked them to find out why this person misled me they returned with \" we have no records. '' I am very concerned about these predatory loan tactics and I am looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I am requesting debt validation for a {$41000.00} charge off that is currently reported by Ditech to my credit report ( XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) and associated with my property XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CO XXXX. I am also requesting that Ditech immediately discontinue attempts to update my credit report with the incorrect address XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CO XXXX and remove my ex-wife, XXXX XXXX, as a joint owner of this debt ( account XXXX ). Ditech is incorrectly reporting my ex-wife, XXXX XXXX, as a joint owner on this debt which is causing her information to erroneously appear on my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX credit reports. I have disputed this address numerous times with Ditech directly due to an identity theft case that has been reported and filed with the XXXX of XXXX, CA police ( attached ). I have also disputed this with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX but have failed to prevent Ditech from continuing to report the XXXX address, causing mail with personally identifying information ( Social Security Number ) to be directed to this address in error. Ditech has stated that they are the current owner of the {$41000.00} debt for account XXXX, purchased from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is the former lien holder/mortgage servicer of the 1st and 2nd mortgage to my property XXXX XXXX XXXX Place, XXXX XXXX, CO XXXX and is the only lien holder on record for this property. XXXX XXXX XXXX is a defunct unit of XXXX that forced many subprime loans to go into default, including the defaulted 2nd mortgage in question that has been purchased and reported to the ( 3 ) Credit Reporting Bureaus by Ditech ( formerly Green Tree ). XXXX successfully removed my ex-wife XXXX XXXX from her financial and legal obligation to repay either loan but failed to provide Ditech any documentation of the removal following the sale to Ditech on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX has never reported the 2nd mortgage to my credit report nor my ex-wife 's credit report until the sale of the defaulted 2nd mortgage to Ditech on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Ditech began reporting to the credit bureaus against XXXX and I both in XXXX. XXXX XXXX is not on the title and 1st mortgage of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In fact, we have been divorced since XXXX and have not lived in the property together since XXXX. The reason the home went into default was because my ex-wife 's parents had a lease-to-own contract for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and failed to pay the 2nd mortgage with XXXX per agreement. The contracted ended and I moved back into the property in XXXX XXXX. XXXX refused to let me do a loan modification and hardship to cure the deficiency on the 2nd mortgage as they stated I needed to be in default prior to approval of the loan modification. My last payment with XXXX was XXXX XXXX when I applied for the loan modification. I called to find out my status, which was declined, but never received anything in writing stating my ability to appeal the rejection within 30 days. I contacted XXXX numerous times to have the letters resent as they were never received as XXXX confirmed over the phone. The loan was forced into default.I never received any letters of acceleration, missed payment, or default from XXXX. I never received anything in the mail regarding the sale of my 2nd mortgage to Ditech until Ditech sent its first notice in XXXX to a MA address I was renting at. XXXX 's mortgage center in XXXX, FL was contacted on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the loan serviced by Ditech. On XXXX XXXX, an agent for XXXX stated that notification letters regarding the rejected loan modification application, default and accelerated payment due to the default were mailed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The agent proceeded to say that I was given \" plenty of opportunity to work with XXXX on curing the deficiency '' because I had been granted a loan modification which allowed me to do so. This is false because a loan modification would require that I receive the necessary tax documents ( 1099 or 1098 form ) to file with the IRS for the XXXX tax year. On XXXX XXXX, the next agent I spoke with at XXXX regarding the loan could not see the loan modification documents or any documents related to the 2nd mortgage serviced by Ditech. The agent stated that Ditech is the owner of the defaulted 2nd mortgage purchased on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and that the letters I never received from XXXX regarding the default, declined loan modification, and acceleration were sent back to XXXX \" Return to sender : not deliverable '' despite the address being correct ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Colorado XXXX ). The agent stated that Ditech purchased the loan and would have all the documents necessary to correct the credit reporting that Ditech is providing to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX against my credit report as well as my ex-wifes, XXXX XXXX. She recommended I follow up with Ditech as they would have all the documents to make my dispute. XXXXs negligence has caused irreversible damage to my credit report in their failure to provide Ditech with the appropriate documentation necessary for accurate credit reporting. As of XXXX XXXX, Ditech stated the only documentation they possess regarding XXXX is a loan application with my ex-wife XXXX XXXX name on it. A loan application is not enough to prove valid ownership of a loan. Ditech is unable to provide me with the documentation that would support XXXXs claims and provide me a resolution to correct the credit reporting against myself and my ex-wife XXXX XXXX. Ditechs inability to validate the debt due to lack of documentation destroys the property value of my home as XXXX can not remove a lien on a property that XXXX does not own. I can not sell or refinance my property as this issue clouds the clear title I would have to guarantee a new mortgagor or buyer of the property.

I filed a complaint with TransUnion and after a while I received a letter with the results of a reported balance of {$300.00}. Right after this they dropped my score another 6 points - a total of 47 points from XXXX to XXXX and I accuse they doing it out of retaliation! For the entire year I had scores from all 3 major Credit reporting agencies at XXXX and above! Never paid late, not one hard inquiry and the average credit use is 2-3 %. The other 2 agencies still kept my score at around XXXX - right now XXXX. This credit rating unjustified and completely out of line compared to the other ratings.

This wasn't my inquiry and I called XXXX on Monday. I took them a while on the phone, but they were able to locate an approved loan application with my social security number and name. The woman on the phone remarked to me that the application had the wrong birthday and address. I then had to go through an arduous and time-consuming process of getting a police report and submitting it to Prosper for them to remove the inquiry. I only did this because I wanted it taken care of, but how can this company make a hard inquiry on my account with incorrect vital information? I'd like this complaint to go to whatever level it can, and hold this lending service responsible for doing a hard pull with incorrect information.\n",

They stated that my failure to remit the payment would result in further collection attempts. I have verified, with the medical office named in the letter, that I do not owe, and have never owed, this amount and that they have never referred any of my information to FBCS. The medical office requested, and has received, a copy of the FBCS letter for their efforts and records.

They also fromXX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXXonly put into our escrow account 6 months worth of property taxes ( {$1400.00} ) instead of the whole year 's taxes ( {$2800.00} ). So we just received a notice on XX/XX/XXXXfrom Wells Fargo stating that our escrow account is {$3000.00} short and if we pay the amount in full our mortgage payment will increase from $ XXXX/month to XXXX XXXX/month or our other option is to pay the shortage over 12 months and then our mortgage payment will increase to $ XXXX/month. I called Wells Fargo to ask them why we have a {$3000.00} shortage in our escrow account. Their explanation to me was that our property taxes and home owner 's insurance increased. I then called our home owners insurance agent and met with him in his office and I called Wells Fargo with the insurance agent present and after an hour and a half of talking with 2 different customer service agents, the customer service agent admitted that Wells Fargo knowingly continued to allow for the XXXX XXXX insurance amount even after we had switched our policy over to XXXX and now they are requiring us to make up the difference all at once now starting XX/XX/XXXXand that they only allowed for 6 months worth of property taxes instead of the entire year 's amount, which is why they are trying to convince us that our property taxes and home owners insurance has significantly increased. They are also telling us that they now require a minimum balance of {$760.00} in our escrow account at all times for which they did not notify us or disclose to us. Our insurance agent told them that this is not right to to do that to their clients and the service agent agreed with him that it is not right for Wells Fargo to do this. This is the 3rd notice in 3 years since our Mortgage was bought by Wells Fargo that states we are short in our escrow account and that our mortgage payment is increasing. Every year our mortgage payment is increasing.\n",

And before that, he made the statement that he would inform them that we couldnt come to an agreement ; Im still not sure who them is. I was trying to explain to him my situation and Im on the verge of bankruptcy, to which he replied that pay day loans cant be claimed in bankruptcy, which is false. I soon realized that he is not calling from a court of law. I admit that I became angry with him, yelled and hung up on him, because it irritates me to no end that he was lying to me. I told him the third time I spoke with him that I was speaking with an attorney. He also wouldnt give me the address of the debt collection company ( I asked more than once ), but finally gave me the website and told me to look it up and get the address from there and see that they are a legitimate company and told me to have my attorney to contact him. I have been considering bankruptcy for a while and in fact did visit with an attorney a while back and I qualify to file, but didnt have enough money for that attorney at the time. I decided to go forward with the bankruptcy and contact an attorney, which I still cant afford, but feel I have to, because of his comment about working in the garnishment Department and the threat I felt when he said it, because I can not afford a garnishment, which now has me worried, because are they suing me or not? Also, when I asked to be mailed confirmation of this debt ( I asked more than once ) he wouldnt do it and I still havent received anything in the mail.\n",

Today I received another notice saying that I had a negative balance of the same {$47.00} even though I clearing up the issue the day before. Now however a {$35.00} overdraft fee was added in a very complicated way. I called the bank at XXXX this morning and spoke to a customer service rep who then explained their very complicated accounting system telling me that no matter if you have funds in your account and a purchase was deducted from your account for this purchase which reduces your available amount, if the merchant submits his payment request 3 days or a week later - if your funds are low at the time of the merchant request for payment, and you don't have enough in your account, you will be charged an overdraft fee ( if the bank decides to pay it ) regardless that the purchase amount was deducted when you made the purchase 3 days or a week ago. I believe that Wells Fargo has been scaling people with low balances. Wells Fargo has really hit me hard with fees since I have been depositing my COVID 19 unemployment checks.

I understand from a phone call today that Synchrony Care Credit has held onto this check since XX/XX/XXXX, not applying it to my account in an attempt to collect more interest I suspect. XXXX XXXX sent them a check for the increased amount on XX/XX/XXXX. The call center agents are hostile and unprofessional and completely irrational. I asked for a supervisor and XXXX came on the phone and was attempting to impersonate a supervisor by repeating he was an \" account manager \" and refusing to confirm whether or not he was a supervisor. When I figured out that he was lying, I asked for a supervisor. He claimed \" none were available '' he was \" very sorry. '' Kept repeating that, like a recording. I asked for my survey and he disconnected the call in a way that I was unable to take the survey, barring me from taking my phone survey. He attempted to pretend to be a supervisor after I asked for one. I was transferred to another call center 's \" buddy, '' which was this guy.

      "VALUE OF S is I applied for a checking account online on XX/XX/XXXX and I received a email asking me to submit a copy of my ID and social security card I had to apply for my social security card so I submitted my ID and my social security card when it arrived I submitted it on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a email saying it was approved to call a number or go to a branch to fund my account so I called the number and nobody answered so I left messages with no luck. I went to the nearest branch to me and the teller asked for address verification. I logged in to my XXXX bill account online and downloaded the most recent statement. She said she couldn't accept it because it had a past due balance even though I showed her if was paid off and XXXX balance. She showed to the branch manager she said she had to send it to her district manager and will get back to me that afternoon. I never heard back from them. On XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke to the branch manager again. She said to take her my cell phone bill So I went back. On XX/XX/XXXX and emailed it to her she said she could not accept it because it was month to month not contract. So i emailed her the new statement of my power bill again and she said she could not accept it because it had a previous balance on it. I explained to her that all the bills have a previous balance on them. She turned me away and she gave me her district managers number I called twice and left voice mails with no luck. I contacted the banker that assisted me with opening my account online and he called the branch manager who told him that I presented different documents with different addresses and could not verify my permanent residence and they were thinking of closing my account and terminating relationships with me. I told him they were lying because I showed them the power bills with the same address and it was proper address verification\n",

      "VALUE OF S is 1 ) It was to my understanding that my student loan debt had been paid in full when I received a collection notice from Action Financial Services ( hereinafter referred to as AFS ). I dispute the validity of this debt, the proof furnished by AFS does not show the origin or history of said debt, nor were they able to provide any viable itemized ledgers. 2 ) Somewhere between the dates ofXX/XX/XXXX andXX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXXI received the first debt collection notice from AFS. ( See Exhibit A ) 3 ) On XX/XX/ I called AFC to inquire about said account, and at that time I officially requested proof of validity of the debt. 4 ) OnXX/XX/XXXX I received documents from AFS ( datedXX/XX/XXXX ) ( See Exhibit B ). These documents acknowledged my request for validation of my obligations. Their letter stated Enclosed is a copy of the document ( s ) that will establish the validity of your debt. Included were 2 documents, the first document was a copy of their payment/financial history section ( See Exhibit C ). This report was irrelevant to me as I am unfamiliar and/or unaware of what the information on this report means. For example, there are codes listed in the transaction type, as there is no key, I am unaware as to what these codes refer to. There is also a column titled Debt Number, again I am unaware of what this information refers to. This document in no way shows how the information provided correlates to the debt AFS is attempting to collect. The second document provided was an unknown 3 page document ( See Exhibit D ). At the top of this document it refers to a Repayment Plan, this document is signed by me and dated XXXX. The information included in Exhibit D is barely legible and it is also incomplete ; there is a page 3, a page 2 and the last page is not numbered. The information provided in Exhibit D is inconclusive of were any debt originated, it also fails to provide any tangible proof of the debt that AFS is attempting to collect from me. 5 ) OnXX/XX/XXXX I called AFS regarding the documents that were sent to me establishing the validity of my debt. I stated to the representative that what they provided was not sufficient proof of the validity of the debt they are trying to collect. During the course of my call, despite my clear agenda to gather more information, the AFS rep made multiple attempts to get me to set up a payment plan. The rep also told me that since I made prior payments on my student loans, that those actions show that I had and/or am accepting the validity of this debt. I stated that I have never made any payments to AFS therefore I have not and am not accepting the validity of this debt. When I asked for more information regarding the origin of this charge and stated that they hadnt done anything to show me what this debt was for. The rep informed me that the burden of proof is on the consumer, and that if I say that I paid this debt that it is my obligation to provide receipts, documentation etc. I asked the rep How am I to provide proof of payment etc. if I dont know what or where this debt came from? He was not able to provide an answer to that question. 6 ) I would also like to point out a few key unsettling facts regarding said debt and the fines and fees being charged by AFS. a. Per the rep on XX/XX/ I was able to obtain the following breakdown regarding the balance they are attempting to collect on : i. {$19000.00} is being collected for Principle ii. {$20000.00} is being collected for Interest iii. {$7000.00} is being collected for Collection Fees b. Although I have been disputing this debt since the first notice was received, the interest keeps accruing at an alarming rate. I dont know what this rate is because I was never provided with any information from AFS regarding rates, terms, etc. On the date that the first AFS notice was rcvd the total debt was listed at {$46000.00} when I called onXX/XX/XXXX by balance was {$46000.00}. This means that in less than one month, and while I was in the process of disputing said debt, the total owed grew by {$130.00}. Your diligent review of this case is much appreciated. Thank you for your assistance.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I received a letter stating that I was late on a payment from XXXX around XX/XX/XXXX. I didn't know what it was as I didn't have any open accounts with XXXX so I sent a letter to them asking them to verify the account in writing in which I never heard from XXXX. I thought it was a mistake. Then in XX/XX/XXXX, I got an alert from my credit bureaus that XXXX said I was 30 days late XX/XX/XXXX. I then tried calling XXXX and was told that there was a mistake on how the account was closed so there was a {$25.00} fee added to the account. XXXX closed this account long before I was done with the payments and I only found that out through my credit report. The account has ALWAYS been in good standings up until they added this 30 day late on a closed account. I wasn't banking with XXXX either so I would have no way of knowing about any fees accessed. There was no notification of any fees due. The XXXX rep stated that she fixed the account and any fees were taken off and that she had properly closed the account on her end. I asked her about the 30 day late and she stated I would have to dispute the account. After talking to several XXXX representatives, I finally got one that stated I should not have receive a 30 day late and that she was disputing the late to have it removed from all 3 credit bureaus. After it was removed, then I get another alert that a 30 day late had been added again to this account for XX/XX/XXXX. There were no issues with this account until they made an error on this CLOSED account and added this 30 day late in XX/XX/XXXX. Now all of a sudden I'm late in XX/XX/XXXX. I was NOT late in XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with another XXXX rep on today and he stated that it LOOKS like I was late in XX/XX/XXXX by making half a payment on one day then half a payment on another day. This is TOTAL XXXX from XXXX. I'm not sure why they are purposely trying to mess up my credit, other than not wanting to except they were wrong in the first place to give me a 30 day late in XXXX when I was not late. I feel that XXXX is purposely trying to punish me because I fought this mistake they made. How can I go with no lates with this account since XX/XX/XXXX, and now all of a sudden lates are coming from everywhere on a closed account. This is not fair or ethical for a business to do. The credit bureaus also are not investigating this matter, they are excepting whatever XXXX says and reporting it. Now XXXX is showing that the account was closed XX/XX/XXXX, when it was closed years before. If XXXX had answered my request of verification when I first asked for this in writing, none of this would be happening. Although they claim their was an issue on their end with the closing of this account, I don't see how that's possible when they closed it, as I had no access to it anymore and it was updated on my credit report as closed.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/18, My wife and I went to the Best Buy Mobile store in XXXX, FL to change our cell phone service from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. At that time, we agreed with the terms to buy one XXXX XXXX and get the second one free. However, we couldn't finalize our contract due to a compudter problem. We were asked by the Best Buy employees to return the next day to complete our contract. When entering the Best Buy Mobile store on XX/XX/18, we were told that both of our new XXXX XXXX 's would be free due to the computer problem from the previous day. We were also told the the store would have to eat the cost ( {$690.00} plus tax ). Of course we agreed to the new terms. For 8 months from XX/XX/18, XXXX XXXX did not bill us for phones. In fact, they gave us a discount for bringing our new XXXX to the new XXXX XXXX Plan. Then on XX/XX/18, we added our daughter to our XXXX account. The phone she added was an XXXX XXXX, and was fully paid for. As a result, XXXX determined that we were not being charged for our XXXX XXXX 's, and backed billed us {$480.00} in XXXX. Before this, we were paying {$60.00} or less for our two lines. I was a bit upset that we were to pay for phones that we were told were free by Best Buy. I called XXXX XXXX several times about this, and finally talked to XXXX corporate ( Mr. XXXX, phone # XXXX ). He told me that XXXX needed reimbursed, and since Best Buy Mobile made the mistake, that they needed to give us a credit, or that they needed to pay XXXX. Then I contracted Best Buy at XXXX about what happened. Best Buy started a file ( XXXX # XXXX ), and referred me to there supervisor XXXX XXXX. For 2 1/2 weeks we emailed numerous times. Thru our emails, she told me that Best Buy Mobile mis-coded our phones as being unlocked. It is now my understanding, that after 8 months of not paying for our phones, that we are to pay 100 % for there mistake. I don't think this is not good business practice, and is why we're asking for help. We previous submitted this same complaint to the Federal Trade Commision, but they recomemded to send our complaint to you. We told Best Buy that honest mistakes do happen, and would be willing to pay something. It seems to me, if a codeing error was made, that it would have been a simple fix. Best Buy Mobile employee are experts when it come to mobile phone, why would they just say there was a computer error, and say our phone were free.

Though she was advised that the card did not actually have a XXXX balance and that the card was not activated correctly. After this the employer was contacted and advised that the cards are paid for in cash and that no history is kept of the purchases, meaning that they could not provide the original card amount.

XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX same clerk who repaired it was on the phone with us walking us thru how to fix it since XXXX nor XXXX could not load on computer. We followed the clerk 's instructions on how to fix it via some instructions he found on XXXX and after 2 days it still did not work. XX/XX/XXXX, I went into XXXX XXXX XXXX asking for a refund and they refused. I gave their merchandise back ( have pics to support this ) and stated I will dispute thru my bank ( us bank ). I called in to dispute the charge and US Bank filed it as fraudulent as I later found out. I specifically explained to US Bank that we are filing a dispute for not receiving the product/service. We were told by US Bank we would receive paperwork in the mail to further explain our dispute and any supporting evidence. We received the refund in about a week. We didn't receive any paperwork as described so we called in. US Bank kept transferring us from dept to dept and stated that they had to refile our dispute. Again we stated we are filing a dispute based on not receiving a product/service. Again, they filed it as fraud as we found out later. A month later we receive a notice stating that after their investigation they didn't discover any fraud as the transaction was done by pin and US Bank withdrew the {$420.00} from my account. I called in again and found out the 2 disputes filed were fraud when I never stated it was fraud. US Bank stated they would refile the claim again. US Bank explained the funds would go back into my account in about a week however the funds never appeared. Multiple calls were made week after week asking when the money would be returned to my account and no one could give an answer. Multiple times as I was on hold for over an hour and transferred from dept to dept as no one could give me a solid answer. Finally, got a hold of someone and they stated based on the type of transaction that was done ( by pin ) it was not fraud. Again i explained I never once said it was fraud I am disputing the fact that I didn't receive my product/service. US Bank stated because 60 days had gone by at this point there's nothing they could do for me as it was too late to file a dispute and to seek legal advice. This claim was handled incorrectly for 60 days and then US Bank covers themselves by stating it's too late to dispute it at this point. This is unfair and I deserve my {$420.00} back for not getting the product/service I paid for. I barely found out about cfpb or I would have filed this a long time ago.\n",

During the period of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, we received ZERO communication from Citi. From XX/XX/XXXX to now, we have made numerous phone calls to Citi and received ZERO promised return phone calls.

All it needs to take place is for the Citi investigator to communicate with us during the dispute, just as XXXX XXXX stated. The promise from Citi executive team is nice, but it seems that it doesn't translate into actions for its investigators. Based on our experience, Citibank has many good people working hard to do the right things for its cardholders.

I asked for validation of the debt since they were claiming to represent XXXX. She said if I had any issues, I should contact XXXX. I informed her that I would be filing disputes with the credit agencies and they needed to show a contract existed and verification of the debt. I then hung up very upset after this call. I filed the dispute days later stating the debt was cancelled with the original creditor, NO Contract and because this was a cell phone bill, the federal statue of limitations of 2 years has been reached ( This claimed contract would be approximately 4-5 years old ).

I also filed the same dispute with the other 2 major credit reporting agencies. Contract Caller 's has not provided any contract or validation. They also have falsely stated this debt is valid. This appears to be their tactic with consumers to try and force them to pay these collection debts that they have procured. As a consumer, we are left helpless to these unscrupulous practices. They currently have over 150 complaints filed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a consumer, I am asking for your assistance in getting this \" collection agency '' to accurately validate and report debt to the credit reporting agencies or no longer be allowed to practice as a business with access to consumers credit files.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I recently filed a fraud dispute with tjx reward card in XX/XX/XXXX. I was a new member and someone got a hold of my credit card and basically maxed it out. My limit at the time was XXXX, I had never used the card ever my credit was negatively affected by a closed account and high utilization and that was the only negative thing on my credit report. Today tjx finally resolved the dispute reversed all the fraudulent charges but unfairly decreased my limit from XXXX to XXXX as punishment for something I didnt do and now this will affect my ortherwise perfect credit. To add injury to insult the dispute wasnt even properly resolved, some charges were not reversed and I now have a late payment from during the period the dispute was going on which will also affect my credit and I never even used the card one time.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My wife and I are in the process of buying a home and when doing a credit check for a Mortgage we were denied. The representative then referred us to a credit advisor who told us much to our surprise that the biggest thing holding us back was a {$120.00} XXXX ( the cell phone co. ) bill now in collections. I say surprise because when we left XXXX in early 2017 we thought everything was settled, we even had verbal confirmation from one of their store reps that everything was up to date and good. This apparently was not the case. Not only did we have no idea of this debt, we did not receive any information from XXXX or a collections agency. Honestly if it wasnt for the advisor we probably would have never known how damaging this was to my credit. With all that being said I do want to make good on my debts. So I contacted XXXX and told them I want to get them off my credit report and to give me the figure to make them disappear, which was the amount said earlier. XXXX told me if payed in full that it would be deleted from my credit report. I was then told by XXXX to contact the collections agency handling this case. While discussing this issue with the collections rep I was told that it would not be deleted, that the best they could do is report the debt as been paid in full. Something about that just did sit well on my mind. So without paying I called my credit advisor to tell them this scenario. They said with us not even knowing about this debt, not receiving any information from collections, and the denial of deleting this from my credit report, to file a complaint and dispute this case. Which is where Im at now. I am willing to pay any and all debts I owe, but under these circumstances I dont believe this particular debt should be on my report.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is In XX/XX/XXXX, My husband and I sold our house and moved from our home in XXXX XXXX, PA. We called the electric company to pay our bill and schedule shut off of our electric at the house. Sometime later in XXXX I received a collection notice from PENN Credit ( acct # XXXX ) regarding a past due elective bill. I did not know where this bill was coming from as my husband and I had to make a final payment in full on the electric bill of our home in order to schedule the power to be shut off at the home we sold. After multiple calls with the electric company and Penn Credit, the end result was that there was a gap from when the new home owners moved in and when XXXX shut our account off. XXXX would not adjust the bill to the correct account. Penn Credit just wanted their money. There was no way to even talk to the new homeowner to try to get them to pay the bill. So, frustrated and not getting help from any direction, my husband and I finally just paid the bill. It was agreed and the representative from Penn Credit confirmed that once I paid the bill over the phone with my bank card on XX/XX/XXXX the account would be removed from our credit report. Months later, the account is still on my credit report and affecting my ability to buy a home. We have spoken with one of the credit bureaus it is being reported to ( XXXX ) and they have indicated that they dont know why it is still on the report and it can be taken off, but needs to come at the request of Penn Credit. Any bank I speak too states the same. We have contacted Penn Credit multiple times and were told I can try to dispute all I want, they will just keep kicking it back that the account is closed but will never take this off of my credit report. They dont have to or want to. This is causing a major financial headache for me in trying to improve my credit and buy a home. I dont know what to do at this point. Penn Credit is preventing me from being able to obtain a loan. I have done what they asked and were promised it would be. I feel like my credit is being harassed and held hostage by this company.\n",

As a credit card customer who pays a yearly fee i thought i was protected from fraud of this sort, however i was unawware and not alerted to suspicious activity.

      "VALUE OF S is Synchrony Bank has decided to close my PayPal account due to me not being able to make the regular payments due to income loss from the pandemic. I work in real estate in XXXX XXXX, commission only, and buyers simply are not qualified any longer for loans because of their own income situations as a result of the pandemic. If people aren't buying, I am not making any money. And this is all due to the pandemic of course - clear and obvious. I am wondering if there is not an exception to them being able to do this - that is, for certain circumstances, actions can be justified or not due, for instance, to acts of God, etc ... unforeseeable reasons. I just do not think it is fair and right for Synchrony Bank to close my accounts or anyone else 's in this historically awful time. It is negatively affecting my credit reports - I just received an alert from XXXX. This just can't be right. Add to this situation that my wife and I subsidize my mother in law 's expenses about 80 % per month - she only receives {$660.00} in XXXX per month. Living in XXXX is a lot more expensive than {$660.00} per month.

I had accumulated XXXX miles in this XXXX account. This from a combination of credit card offers, direct spend on these credit cards and yes, some miles from 2 specific revenue flights. The flights that were canceled has cost an additional XXXX total from my XXXX account. On to the Citi part. From some internet research about this issue, it appears that XXXX is doing this to many \" customers ''. The consensus is apparently that I obtained too many credit cards ( and associated bonus miles ) from Citi. Their belief is that using only Citi 's most strict rules, you can only get 3 or so credit cards in a 2 year period. Offers that Citi sends through the USPS mail have less strict restrictions and it is easy to obtain more than the limits XXXX is applying. In short, Citi approved \" too many '' credit cards for me and Citi 's partner, XXXX XXXX, thought that my count was too high. Without warning or recourse, they closed my account. Citi provided me with generous credit card sign up bonuses that were subsequently taken away by their partner, XXXX. XXXX believes it can do anything it wants with its program and for any reason. Citi does not provide a warning during the application process and somehow happily allows customers to sign up for too many ( in XXXX 's eyes ). The frustrating part about this is that Citi can claim it was XXXX committing this foul, where XXXX makes vague claims and the bottom line is it thinks Citi gave out too many credit cards with bonuses. I suspect XXXX sold these miles to Citi. Citi issues them to me after meeting various financial obligations ( a significant cost to me ), then XXXX takes them away? What kind of scam is this? I will note, also, that Citi continues to offer XXXX XXXX credit cards to customers with XXXX mile bonuses. I still don't see a warning about XXXX 's \" right '' to take them away as they please.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is When I first started XXXX XXXX in early XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX recommended CareCredit to finance payments ( a service provided by My Synchrony Bank ). I was supposed to have until XX/XX/XXXX interest free. I trusted that My Synchrony would not charge me interest, and I put my account on Auto Pay. A few months ago, I discovered the bank had been charging me \" Card Security '' fee every month. In addition, they were also charging me interest all along!!! \" Card Security '' fees ranged from $ XXXX- {$40.00} dollars a month, and interest within that range as well. I called the bank several times to get to the bottom of this issue. However, they kept sending me in circles. When I called the number on the back of my CareCredit card, they said that this so-called \" Card Security '' service is not from the bank itself. They gave me a different number to call. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally issued a refund for {$830.00}. I never requested this service. They should have never charged me this \" hidden '' fee. This is malpractice. Adding insult to injury, the interest refund I received was only {$20.00}. It is the interest charge for XX/XX/XXXX ONLY. This bank has been charging me interest for years. I called repeatedly, and they have either ignored me, or manipulated me in an endless circle of talking to different people and no one can do anything. Every time I asked for a supervisor, they regurgitated the same old response \" We will escalate this issue and respond within 5 business days ''. It has been months and I still don't have a simple response. I learned through persistent calls that interest charges were associated with \" Card Security '', and Synchrony Bank kept telling me they \" couldn't remove those charges. '' Again, I never requested this service, and I was incurring interest charges for a service I never requested. I called \" Card Security '' over and over again, and they said they couldn't do anything to remove those charges, and that the issue will be escalated. I received a call from a woman named XXXX once or twice, who claims to be XXXX XXXX, and I have been calling her again and again. I could not get a hold of her. This has been ongoing for over 1 month. I want this issue to solved without further delays from Synchrony.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Thiscomplaintsubmission is in regards to a false credit report by ENHANCED RECOVERY COMPANY ( ERC ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX. I have made attempts to rectify this matter with them directly as they have now been unresponsive. I spoke with two different representatives who were extremely rude and stated I am responsible for this debt then hung up the phone. I then spoke with another representative who gave me their company email number so I could forward them a Debt Of Validation letter, which was sent on XX/XX/2019. It was confirmed through a response by an ERC representative that they had received the files ; however, after 30 days of notifying them, still no response. ENHANCED RECOVERY COMPANY ( ERC ) then removed themselves from my credit report. After a month went by, ERC then reported again to the 3 Credit Bureaus and also violated our CEASE & DECIST agreement. At this point in time ENHANCED RECOVERY COMPANY ( ERC ) has failed to provide any proof of debt and/or anything in signature or judgment by law stating I was obligated to pay them the total of ( {$390.00} ). I have never made any agreement with them or with the original creditor to pay anything nor was I properly notified of this false reported debt. I am requesting ENHANCED RECOVERY COMPANY ( ERC ) immediately remove me from their systems and update all 3 major Credit Bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX ) on this action. At this point they have failed to provide any competent evidence or any legal obligation. ENHANCED RECOVERY COMPANY ( ERC ) is currently in violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practice Act, 15 USC 1692g, and if this report is not updated immediately I will be taking legal actions.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Hello CFPB : I am contacting you in an attempt to have expeditious results regarding the escrow analysis that I received in the mail on yesterday with a payment due on XXXX XXXX. I contacted the Senior VP/General Counsel ( XXXX XXXX ) via email and asked that Please correct this matter within five business days of this communication. I also talked with XXXX XXXX of the Specialty Division of Shellpoint Mortgage at XXXX. In XXXX, I secured a construction loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX who later transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX transferred to ShellPoint Mortgage Services. Since that time, I have experienced repeated errors in the accounting and billing which have caused much grief and anxiety. Last Spring, I sent a mortgage payment in with three advance payments earmarked for three future mortgage payments. The mortgage was applied to my principal. Surprisingly, I received a default letter for the next month. It took over a month and six phone calls to different representatives and four emails to various departments to have it corrected. Even after it was corrected, another error occurred which led to more phone calls and inconveniences. On last night, I came home to read my escrow analysis. The XX/XX/XXXX amount due is {$6300.00}. I am showing a current escrow balance of - {$24.00}, XXXX. This can not be correct. My yearly taxes and insurance don't exceed {$2500.00} a year. In addition, XXXX XXXX sent a copy of the homeowners insurance twice to Shellpoint when requested. I am being told that my taxes were delinquent form XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. However, the County Tax Portal shows that the taxes were paid. I have never been delinquent on taxes. Also, the cushion of {$4.00}, XXXX ( 1/6 ) is unconscionable. My original lender has a 1/12 cushion clause. Therefore, the terms of my loan can not change due to transfer. This cushion was not contracted for and is NOT reasonable. How many average working persons can afford to pay an extra {$4900.00} with less than a months notice. In closing, I am requesting that this matter be corrected within five business days of this correspondence to you. I should only be responsible for the {$790.00} contracted in the original loan and the {$160.00} escrow and possibly a cushion on 1/12 not 1/6 per my original loan. Regards, GP\n",

I provided everything that they asked me for and yet in still they are treating me as though i did this myself. Their exact reason that they have on a message on their site for my account is the pin for the card was not changed prior to the period for unauthorized usage and no declines for insufficient funds so the person making the transactions had inside knowledge of the account balance. This is crazy because they did 9 {$43.00} transactions and by the time i was able to get through the prompts on Netspend customer service line to stop this debit card, i only had {$100.00} and something dollars left in my account. I'm so upset because i need my {$400.00} and i'm upset because i have been with this company Netspend for years and this is how they treat their loyal customers.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Dear XXXX, US Bank uses overdrafts in every way it can to charge their customers. They charge their customers excessively in order to add to their earnings per share. The following is my experience. I would not have received this kind of customer service at my other bank. I made several purchase from XXXX for the first time. I went to the bank to deposit an additional amount of money to account for the purchases. I was unware XXXX debited the account after hours for a purchase I believed I accounted for during reconciliation. U.S Bank normally debits the account immediately. XXXX debited the account after business hours and I was unable to deposit additional funds. I was unaware of this until I logged in. When I logged in, I saw an overdraft of {$36.00}. I called in to customer service to explain the situation and expected the {$36.00} to be refunded. I spoke to 'XXXX ID # XXXX. She put me on hold for several minutes. This was a simple housekeeping error. XXXX did not provide the 5 star customer service the bank advertises. After about 5 minutes, she stated she is unable to waive the fee. I was very unhappy and dissatisfied with the length of time it took for this minor housekeeping issue. I asked for her ID # and she would not provide it to me. I asked several times and she did not respond. I asked for a manager which took about another 5 minutes. XXXX ID # XXXX a a manager took over. She was unable to provide the 5 star customer service and stated she would not refund the {$36.00}. This bank chargers overdrafts in a manner that is excessive. This needs to be reviewed. They use the overdrafts as a way add to the earnings per share. This call I initiated should have been 5 minutes. Instead, US bank and its management use these situations to penalize their hard working customers. It is a very poor customer service tactic. US Bank does not care that I am a very dissatisfied regarding this conclusion. They are happy to charge me {$36.00}. I will be closing my accounts and using my other banking relationships. I will be relaying this experience to my attorney who will send a letter in order to get this on the record.\n",

I left the cruise ship on XX/XX/XXXX and was given a billed for {$1300.00}. I had another trip i was going to after the cruise to Mississippi I had more than enough to cover my balance for the cruise and moved additional {$500.00} for my trip to Mississippi on the XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I checked my balance and the XXXX XXXX transaction was already taken out and I had {$960.00} in checking and {$520.00} in savings.

On XX/XX/XXXX I check my emails and receive an email notice that my funds were below XXXX. So I checked my account online to find my balance as - {$200.00} in checking and that they took the additional funds of {$520.00} out of my savings to cover the overdrafts of purchase from XXXX XXXX after the one billed amount of {$1300.00}.

( As XXXX XXXX explains they don't do one by one transactions they do one big bill to the bank and give us a copy of the itemize statement for our records ) So I was transferred to a Fraud Specialist to file a claim. XXXX did not take it my claim very seriously treated like charges were correct. I had to advise him over and over that the cruise line doesn't do the charges like this and I had already paid the charges. Then he states this happens all the time and blame the XXXX merchants for the issue. And to not worry. My checking and savings were depleted he gave me claim # XXXX and told me \" if '' they were duplicated I would be refunded. When I got back into town on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX to complain about the charges and the rep provided the details on how they send the charges to the banks and fax them the same statements that we get so they won't overcharge the customer. However Well Fargo does not take their fax statements. So when I explained the issue to that rep she so empathy and advise that she would send the request again to try to get this issue straighten out. XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my balance today and they are now showing my balance to be {$650.00} in checking and {$0.00} in savings. So I call back to Well Fargo in regards to this issue about my funds in the savings. The reps explains to me these are the funds from both my checking and savings that they can account for. I advised to her I have the statements before this mess and she advised that the may not show my true balances on those statements. I asked if that was the case how where they able to take funds from my savings as overdraft she advised that my account is setup to cover my checking when it is low she still couldn't explain where the money went that they were showing pending. I have not use the card since it was flagged there are no pending charges. She advised that was my balance and they were closing the claim. Only when I advised that I was reporting them to CFPB is when she advised that they were sending me to a Resolution Specialist I was placed on an extended hold for minutes and no one came back on the line. I have copies of the statements before and after this trip as proof I had more money than {$650.00} in my account. I have been ROBBED BY WELLS FARGO!!!

      "VALUE OF S is I spent considerable time on the telephone and going through several \" escalation '' personnel to try to resolve the issue with Bank of America. This involves an account that was closed at my request and regular payments were debited from my checking account until the balance was paid in full. When the debiting stopped, I assumed the debt was paid. Three years later I received a 1099-C from Bank of America indicating a cancellation of debt in the amount of {$890.00}, which was supposedly the remaining unpaid balance. Bank of America would not let me pay this amount when I offered, saying that it was already written off of its books. I received a tax bill from the IRS for the {$890.00} increased income, resulting in additional taxes of almost {$300.00}, which I paid.

      "VALUE OF S is My credit report was pulled multiple times by my previous loan officer- XXXX XXXX without my consent. I initially gave consent the first time she pulled my report. After that, she continuously pulled my report without notifying me or asking if she could. When I discovered she had done this around XXXX times, I confronted her. She said she would ask for the credit pulls to be revoked. That was in XX/XX/2020. It has been 4 months and none of the credit pulls that followed the first pull have been removed from my report. This is a gross misuse of my personal information and credit report! I should not have to be worried about my own lender sabotaging my credit. Furthermore, I would like to report immoral business practices. I was originally contacted by XXXX, she said she was with my companys retention department and that I qualified for a lower interest rate. She did not disclose that I would have to PAY to qualify for a lower rate! Instead she waited until it was time to sign papers and I saw an exorbitant amount of fees being charged for points. When I approached her about this, she verbally abused and manipulated me saying how hard she had worked on my loan and that she isnt an hourly employee, etc etc. not only did she wait until this time to disclose this, it is my opinion that she also had me pay for my appraisal out of pocket in order to make me feel financially obligated to carry through this refi, as I was never given paperwork before the appraisal to go over the fees and costs to get the loan. Overall I was partially scammed XXXX {$750.00} for the appraisal ) and my credit report was also misused. Now, I have my loan in deferment and can not access my account. Their mobile app has not worked in weeks and their website just had me set up a secondary authentication with my phone number. When trying to log in after this, I would initiate the authentication text but it never comes to my phone! I am now locked out of my account. I was given paperwork with an email for the deferment department. I have tried to email it several times and it comes back that the server rejected the email or that the address can not be found! It does not seem like this company cares about its people and it does not seem like they are set up to actually help customers while in deferment!\n",

I want my money reimbursed and I want these fraudulent credit reporting agencies to be shut down because they are not reporting anything close to accurate on anybodys credit report due to this bridge and they have no intention of fixing it or they would have by me submitting the five different times Ive tried dispute everything on my credit file and everything came back as not disputable because they were valid debts but yet only my name and a dead amount is on 3 % of the reports so I dont know how they contacted anybody if there wasnt even a name given\n",

I went home and logged into my account and discovered that I posted the payment to another one of my Synchrony account and I immediately called Synchrony and spoke to XXXX. She informed me that she was able to transfer the payment to my car care account and that the late fee would automatically be waived because they could tell when the payment was made.

XXXX told me that the payment was not transferred even though XXXX told me that my payment was being transferred. I told her that I did not have any faith in Synchrony and had problems with them in the past and was fearful that they would report this information to the credit bureaus erroneously. I also told her that if it was not fixed today that I would file a complaint with the regulatory agencies because Synchrony has received my payment on time and is now playing games and harassing me about making an additional payment for $XXXX. At that point XXXX told me that she was going to transfer my call to a supervisor to get it fixed for me today and placed my call on hold.

      "VALUE OF S is Hi, I have recently found out through my credit report that XXXX XXXX, a loan service company that works directly with XXXX University, has filed multiple reports against my credit, because of delinquent payments. But on the report it doesn't state why my payments were delinquent. I am always on top of my loan and debt repayments ; however, XXXX is an unreliable company which makes repayments almost impossible. My loans first became due on XX/XX/XXXX. Since that day until XXXX of XXXX, I made several attempts to repay my loans by either visiting their website or calling them. Whenever I visited XXXX 's website I encountered a message claiming that \" service is unavailable ''. This happened every single time I visited their website. Since, repayments through website was obviously not a solution, I attempted calling the company on various days at various times. I would either receive a busy tone, or the call would keep ringing without anyone ever responding. To investigate this further, I called XXXX University 's loan and financial department, and a represintive went over different possibilities. They told me that XXXX often has these problems, and it is very like that they are changing the service provider for those loans, and I shouldn't worry about. That was a relief to hear as XXXX seemed very shady in the way they conducted business. Unavailable website and customer service can be very very alarming. This company has wasted a lot of my time from writing this complaint, calling them, visiting their website, etc. I shouldn't chase after them and waste every day of my life to hopefully catch their uptime. This is unreasonable. On XXXX of XXXX, I was able to access their website, and realized they are still handling my loan. Their website 's interface is not intuitive and errs on the simplest actions and inputs. Even with all these obstacles, the first thing I did was to setup ACH so that they could directly transfer money from my bank account. Again, this was the first thing that I did to prevent any delinquent repayments in the future. I believe the way that XXXX handled my case is absolutely wrong and bizarre, since they provided no medium for me to take care of my repayments at all. XXXX 's business is very concerning and suspicious. No transparent communications, no website, and no customer service. Even as I am writing this the website is unavailable. However, this time it doesn't even show any messages, the website just doesn't load at all. I have tried to load the website in different browsers and still no luck. I have attached the picture of one of the instances when I visited the company 's website to make a payment. This problem was so frequent, I took a screenshot. In case something like this would ever happen. I am glad I did.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I purchased and closed on a condo on XX/XX/2016. I obtained my financing thru XXXX XXXX who was at that time working for XXXX. I 've attached his current contact info. XXXX never informed me that XXXX was being purchased by Chemical Bank, which purchase was in the news 2 weeks later. He sent me an email the day he left XXXX to go to XXXX XXXX Bank informing me of his move and that he was very upset with Chemical Bank. I believe, along with a couple of other Realtors who have done business with him, that he may have deliberately not passed along the appropriate info to spite them. That being said, I know that it 's ultimately the bank 's job to get things done correctly and legally. XXXX told me I was getting a conventional portfolio loan for the condo purchase ( {$110000.00} purchase price ) with a {$23000.00} XXXX Homestyle Construction Loan ( on PA ) attached for renovation. I had to go thru a ton of hoops to get my financing but finally got the clear to close a month after the original contracted date. We closed on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX with a closing agent who had not previously seen nor done any work on my file so she was flustered making me the same. The contractor who was going to do the interior work on my condo was at the closing as well but he was not asked by XXXX to sign the Construction Indemnity Agreement which has created a ton of duress since he made a mess of my condo, left the job XX/XX/XXXX, refused to the lien waivers needed to receive payment and has filed a Notice Of Lis Pendens XX/XX/XXXX. Although the Construction Contract I signed states that I am the contractor, Chemical Bank has refused to give me any draws from my construction loan leaving me in financial squeeze play. Although the only person in Chemical Bank 's entire staff who I 've been told repeatedly has any say regarding my construction rider, XXXX XXXX, says he refuses to disburse any of my money has been saying it 's due to the contractor, I believe it 's actually due my {$23000.00} having been stolen/laundered or vanished by some other means or person. I 've repeatedly asked both the XXXX and XXXX where the money is/for accounting or deposit records but they both refuse to give them or any other info. I 've attached the Closing Disclosure, XXXX Settlement Statement and most recent Chemical Bank statement. I do n't have a GFE and XXXX XXXX claims he does n't have access to it. The CD and XXXX do n't match up. They have different purchase prices, {$110000.00} and {$140000.00}. XXXX has a construction holdback. The CD does not. Another title company said a Commencement of Construction should have been recorded but was not. There is not a broker statement in my package either. XXXX XXXX, my broker until last Friday, has financial interest in XXXX.. When I started asking questions about all of this mess, XXXX deactivated my business email account along with other necessary computer/electronic signing capabilities, thus hiding evidence of all the work I did to try getting this figured out and resolved, along with making it impossible for me to work. All of my business contacts and their info was in the programs. I sure am hoping you can help! Thanks in advance.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I was a victim of identity theft in XX/XX/2017 in which someone stole person information, filed my taxes and began opening and attempting to open several fraudulent accounts in my name. I have been working with local law enforcement, the three credit reporting agencies and the account lenders. In sending in copies of police reports, federal trade commission reports, proof of my ID as the rightful owner and other supporting documents, over the past two years I have obtained little to no success in trying to successfully remove these accounts from my credit report. I have in writing, on several occasions asked that the lenders send me proof of whatever SIGNED documents that have confirming that these accounts were opened by \" me '' and they have not responded or sent me copies of these documents per my request. When I speak with the credit reporting agencies, they simply state that the debts were verified by the lenders but CAN NOT either provide me with the requested documents to corroborate their investigations. I have been denied job opportunities, other loans, and even bank accounts due to these accounts and at this point I want results.

      "VALUE OF S is In XX/XX/2020, I submitted a refinance application with my existing mortgage lender, Flagstar financial. I have an excellent credit score, no financial hardships, solid employment history and was not requesting any cash out. It was a simple refi to change the rate from a 30 year@ 5.25 % to a 20 year@ 2.875 %. Over the past 5 months Flagstar has conditionally approved the application package multiple times only to request additional disclosure statements regarding any changes to bank account balances between XXXX through XXXX, multiple credit reports XXXX through XXXX and most recently a signed explanation statement regarding inquiries of competing lenders on my credit report last week. The latest reason for Flagstar 's two week delay is because I attempted to research competing lenders who were interested in refinancing my loan for to the extensive and unnecessary delays created by flagstar. Once I informed flagstar of this action they responded that closing should take place within a week 's time ; therefore I did not pursue other lenders interest. With industry standards being 30-60 days for new applicants to close on a refi, I suspect Flagstar is intentionally delaying the closing of my refinance considering it's in their best interest to keep me paying my current mortgage at a higher rate. Additionally, the have not disclosed how much these delays are costing ( in both interest and term ) me per month. Finally, since XXXX refi rates have increased and competing lenders are not able to match the original lock in rate from XX/XX/2020.\n",

My wife attempted contact with the hospital and they refused to speak to her \" because she's not the responsible party ''. Please. Respect yourself enough to do your job. The collection agency has nothing signed by me agreeing to a debt. I was not there. My insurance was not used. It's not my debt. I'm not the responsible party. There is absolutely no proof that this is my debt, because it's not. I was on shift that day, all day. Please investigate it.

      "VALUE OF S is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX I called the Best Buy ( citibank ) Credit Card customer support to get a payoff amount, make payment and close the account. This was completed at that time, amount/payment made/closed account. On XX/XX/XXXX Best Buy/citibank withdrew {$190.00} in autopay on a paid off, closed account. I called customer support immediately upon seeing this on my banks app. I was told then that it was a mistake and would be refunded within 10 days. No refund was completed so I called back, asked to speak to a supervisor and was again told it would be 7-10 days. On the XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Citi that the refund was being processed and should be in my account within 3 days. No refund appeared within the timeframe so I called again, they gave me a account number the refund went to which was not mine, nor the account the money had been withdrawn from. After advising them of their inaccuracy and reproviding the correct account number, I asked how and why this could happen, the account had been set up on autopay and the {$190.00} they withdrew was from the same account I had just re provided. Again I was told 7-10 days. I called again the following week and requested to be transferred to the next level management as every answer was becoming 7-10 days. Upon reaching the Executive response team, they agreed that they made the mistake both by withdrawing the money to begin with but also for refunding it to \" some other account which was not mine ''. I was told by that team that they had another 7-10 days to review and work on the issue. I received a call ( the first callback during this issue ) on the XX/XX/XXXX from the executive response team stating that the only issue left was for her to get verbal confirmation from me that I did not have an account ending in XXXX ( the account they sent the money to ), I confirmed and restate here that I do not have an account ending in those numbers. Her response was that she would rush that confirmation to the \" other office in charge of disbursements '' and to expect the refund in my correct account within 5-7 days. Upon yet again not receiving the refund I called today XXXX and again spoke with my executive account specialist ( XXXX ) XXXX, she advised me she had been given bad information and that they also needed to recover the money from the erroneous account prior to paying me back for their error. ( I would like to reiterate that even today Citi confirms they made a mistake, they know I don't own the account they supposedly sent the money to, that they will not refund their mistake-my money until they get theirs back ). During this phone conversation which they record, my specialist also informed me that : 1. She now had a response date/iou to me to get back to me by XXXX. 2. They/Citi can't/wo n't as a matter of policy refund me until they secure their money first. 3. They have no ability to find anything out about the account they sent it to as they do not know who owns it, nor can the receiving bank give out information without the account owners approval, but she has until the XXXX to get back to me, they sent the receiving bank a letter and \" I hope they can help ''. I requested to speak to the next level of management as I simply could not believe a company as large as Citi could do business in such a way. She told me the next level was the office manager but he wouldn't have access to my account. I said that was fine I would still like to speak to him. She then asked me why as he had no account access? I stated he didn't need to have account access, I wanted to ask him about policy. She then informed me that the office manager doesn't speak to customers. I found these actions pretty telling and is what prompted me to contact Consumerfinance.gov. We are currently on day 58 of this process as of XXXX and the only difference today from XX/XX/XXXX is that instead of the past 7-10 response time promised, Citi has done 2 things, one upped the time frame to 21 days and 2 advised me they won't refund me until they get their money and they have no way to do that. Citi employees words not mine. Any help you can provide on this will be greatly appreciated as I see this as fraud on the part of Citibank/Best Buy Credit institution.\n",

The Hacker got into my husband 's online account and transferred XXXX dollars from his credit card to our personal account, where they then used our checking account to purchase XXXX $ worth of items from XXXX in Florida, several states away. We did not become aware it was fraud until a few days later, when the charge appeared on our statement and went to close the account. The account was immediately close, new cards were issued and new accounts issued. A claim was sent to the Fraud dept. to look over. They denied that it was fraud through the dept. 4 separate times, each time siting incorrect reasoning for denying the claim. I have been calling into the department no less than three times for each claim, so 12 multi hour phone calls have been used to try and get to the bottom of this issue.

The following week, I called Citi to make sure I was providing all the information possible to support my claim and asked if I could do more, such as provide photos or other evidence that the cups weren't able to be separated. Citi said that I've done all I can do and that I needed to wait 45 days for a response from the Merchant. On XX/XX/2019, I got a notification from Citi that the merchant had responded to my disputes. Citi asked me to provide a signed letter and address the merchant 's response, along with proof of return and documentation that supports my position. At this time, I only saw one letter come up on my Citi portal, so I addressed the {$430.00} dispute. On XX/XX/2019, I submitted my response for the {$430.00}, detailing my position ( as asked ) for why the cups were defective. I also explained that the merchant would not provide return shipping, though I asked them to twice. I also explained that the merchant provided INCORRECT information about the wrong case. They presented their case with bad information, which I pointed out in my letter. On XX/XX/2019, I saw and submitted my response for the {$1200.00} dispute. The response was identical to the response for the {$430.00} dispute. I detailed my position ( as asked ) for why the cups were defective. I also explained that the merchant would not provide return shipping, though I asked them to twice. I also explained that the merchant provided INCORRECT information about the wrong case. On XX/XX/2019, Citi notified me that my dispute credit of {$430.00} had been made permanent. On XX/XX/2019, Citi notified me that my credit of {$1200.00} would be reversed and billed to me. I called Citi to ask why and spoke with a supervisor named XXXX. I couldn't get a straight answer from XXXX. At first, she said Citi attempted to go to pre-arbitration. Then she said they went to arbitration but Visa declined because they didn't have enough proof. I pointed out that the merchant didn't provide ANY proof because they sent a response to the WRONG case and XXXX told me that \" we all know what they meant ... we're talking about the same thing. '' XXXX then told me that Visa requires proof of return. She then explained that there might not ever be proof of a return if the merchant doesn't accept the return. I told her that the merchant would accept the return but that they didn't provide the label. I had made the merchandise available for them to pick up and they didn't come. I explained that I did everything I possibly could to return the merchandise to a merchant who would never accept it and XXXX explained that Citi can't help because Visa won't accept the arbitration. XXXX talked over me so I'm not sure she ever actually heard me. She was very difficult to work with and it took me so long to try to understand what she was saying because she gave contradicting information. I asked why one charge dispute was made permanent and one was reversed when the cases were identical and she said that one must have been just for the downpayment, which didn't require merchandise to be sent back. I reiterated that the letters from Citi, the response from the merchant to the WRONG cases, and my responses were identical. I doesn't make sense that one charge was reversed while the other was made permanent. XXXX just reiterated that it was because Visa wouldn't accept the arbitration and that there was nothing Citi could do.\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX my mortgage loan was transferred to new servicer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Upon reviewing my online account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX between late XX/XX/XXXX to mid XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed my ESCROW account was in the negative for over {$2300.00}. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to find out why my ESCROW account was negative but a representative stated \" we have no idea as to why, please contact Meadowbrook Financial Mortgage Bankers Corp ''. I called my first mortgage loan servicer and my broker XXXX XXXX but he had no answers for me. From that point on I grew suspicious and felt there were malpractices going on. Miraculously the same day I raised awareness about my ESCROW account being negative, was the same day my ESCROW account was in good standings. At this point I started doing a lot of investigating and going over my disclosures carefully. There were a few red flags on my disclosures such as the wrong race ( which I complained about before ), it indicated that I've done a phone interview ( I clearly did a face to face interview ), an extra brokers point was taken from closing, the RESCIND documents were never present nor signed, a fraudulent Commitment was made to buy my loan some approval time and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the actual broker that closed my loan ) name ws nowhere to be found on my disclosures.

      "VALUE OF S is I have been receiving 3 to 6 robocalls each day (including weekends and holidays) to my cell phone from Synchrony Bank (XXXX, XXXX) in an attempt to collect a debt. The calls began in XX/XX/2019 when my accounts were not more than 45 days delinquent and at times start prior to XXXX, the earliest call being XXXX. I have been working with a debt settlement program since XX/XX/2019 which has been in contact with Synchrony Bank and is in the negotiation process on all accounts yet I still receive these calls. I ended up blocking the numbers and sending all calls directly to voicemail. My voicemail specifically states that I do not accept calls from unidentified numbers, robocalls calls, or automated messages and to leave a live voicemail and I will return the call. The XXXX number is the only number to leave a voicemail and only on 3 occasions. The voicemails were automated voicemails and did not identify the caller but requested me to contact the phone number and also provided an address. Looking up the address on the internet helped my identify the caller as Synchrony Bank. I finally called the number back yesterday after being extremely frustrated with the notifications going off on my phone for the blocked calls and no messages being left. I have also begun to receive calls from pinger numbers within 2 minutes of receiving a call from Synchrony. This is absolute harrassment. They cannot robocall my cell phone in an attempt to collect a debt, cannot call prior to XXXX, and they cannot call my phone that many times a day and not identify themselves.

      "VALUE OF S is I applied for a Frontier Mastercard in the last week of XX/XX/2019. I had to call after booking my flight because I was denied in the web application and I knew that was a mistake since my FICO and credit score were both very high and I always pay my bills on time. I was approved when I called and subsequently called back to make sure i was getting the advertised promotion, XXXX bonus miles after a {$500.00} spend within the first 90 days. I spoke to XXXX in the customer service department that day, who confirmed I would be getting XXXX bonus miles, he also confirmed the annual fee of {$79.00} ( which is fine ) and the {$100.00} flight voucher every year when reaching a minimum spend ... It's funny because I was also entitled to the flight voucher within 30 days but my card didn't arrive in the mail before my flight to XXXX XXXX so I basically had to forfeit my {$100.00} .... Already an annoyance but technically not fraud. The customer service agent on I spoke to about my XXXX bonus miles WHEN I OPENED MY ACCOUNT had an identifier of \" XXXX '' ( named XXXX ) and I spoke to him at XXXX MST on XX/XX/XXXX via telephone. I asked if he would send me any kind of confirmation of the XXXX promotion and he said there would be no need. Great. Well, the liars and thieves at BarclayCard only gave me XXXX miles and said that was the promotion at the time I applied when I called them yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). LIES. I want them to review the phone call and HONOR what I was TOLD when I called. They refused to let me speak to a supervisor yesterday, hung up on me, and then responded to my online complaint that I don't know what I am talking about. But I demand a transcript of my call with XXXX if they are not going to honor what was discussed. The current promotion is actually XXXX miles so really they're just being cheapskates by not giving me the XXXX. I was supposed to have gotten my first flight for free too ( well, {$100.00} off ... ) but I'm not even complaining about THAT since I get the card in the mail before my first flight so I'm not worried about that ( since those terms were not met ), but I am only worried about the XXXX miles being basically stolen from me and Barclays lying over and over again about it. This is so wrong and I feel so cheated and it is ILLEGAL TO DO THIS.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is XX/XX/2019 Customer : XXXX XXXX XXXX CR XXXX XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX USAA Customer # XXXX Company : USAA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX ( XXXX ) XXXX Complaint : On XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from USAA indicating that I had a late payment on my auto insurance. I was threatened that if I submitted another late payment I would not have access to my accounts ( checking, savings, policy, products, etc. ). In addition, I would not have access to additional services and/or products from USAA. My payment was made within the grace period, and my insurance has never been cancelled due to non-payment in 28 years. On XX/XX/2019 I called USAA to inform them that I made all auto insurance payments within the due dates and/or grace periods. My insurance has never been cancelled or reinstated in the 28 years I have been banking with USAA. The employee confirmed that my insurance has never been cancelled and all payments have been received within the time dates and/or grace periods allowed. 1 ) I received a threatening letter indicating that future late payments would result in punitive actions such as no access to accounts, policy 's, and/or products. 2 ) USAA does not specifically stipulate what is considered as a punitive payment time period. When is a payment considered late with punitive measures ( no access to accounts and/or products )? 3 ) Is a payment beyond the grace period, such as a cancellation of auto policy equal no access to accounts, products and services ; and deem that a customer does not have access to their checking/savings accounts or USAA products? 4 ) Is a late payment within the grace period still terms for cancellation of auto policy, no access to accounts, products and services ; and deem that a customer does not have access to their checking/savings accounts or USAA products? The attached letter from USAA was offensive. My payments have always been made within the payment date and/or grace period of payment. If USAA is going to submit such offensive, threatening, oppressive, and harassing letters ; it is important that USAA clearly defines such punitive measures to their customers. Resolution : Without retaliation upon this customer, USAA needs to define punitive measures and at what point punitive action will be taken. Further, do these punitive measures follow the state law and regulations with the FDIC, State Board of Insurance, and the Consumer Financial Bureau? Are punitive measures fair practices or discriminatory practices? Is it fair to ban a customer from an insurance policy or cancel a policy, lose access to checking and savings accounts, lose access to usaa.com, lose access to automated voice response system, and unable to acquire new products and services on the basis that the customer is late, however has made payments within USAAs stipulated grace period? It seems that left undefined by USAA is discriminatory to the customer, especially if the customer has paid within the grace period criteria and the customer has never received a cancelation in a purchased policy. I do believe USAA needs guidance in defining punitive customer exclusionary practices and measures. This should be approached without retaliatory measures to the customer. After complaining on XX/XX/2019 at approximately XXXX my account was locked and I have no access to my accounts. This seems a bit suppressive, oppressive, and discriminatory to the customer. I would like it resolved promptly. XXXX, XXXX XXXX USAA Customer # XXXX\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My husband and I were planning to purchase a new car with about 60 % financing ( $ 15,000+ cash down and {$26000.00} car loan ) in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX and began the process on XX/XX/XXXX to unfreeze our credit reports with the three agencies. Within minutes, we were able to successfully unfreeze both our credit reports through XXXX and XXXX via their websites, but ran into problems doing the same on the Experian website. We then attempted to unfreeze our reports on the Experian telephone system, then attempted to contact a live person through Experian customer service at XXXX to no avail. Regarding my husband 's report, at first from his Experian website attempts, he thought he would have to mail in an unfreeze request along with all his personal ID information, copies of Social Security card and insurance or bank statements which he did not want to do because of both the hassle factor and because of the privacy issue of mailed papers getting into the wrong hands and uncertainty of knowing who would be looking at his material. He tried again a couple days later via the Experian website to unfreeze his credit and was successful. For my report, I went through the process online with a freeze PIN number I had received from Experian in XX/XX/XXXX and got feedback on XX/XX/XXXX that my PIN number no longer was valid. I also tried to reach a live person on the telephone, but had to dial the number XXXX numerous times and then proceeded through all the steps on their telephone system to either unfreeze my credit or to reach a live Experian person. I finally reached a live person on XX/XX/XXXX who determined that I would receive a new PIN number in the mail in the next 5 to 7 days which arrived to my mail box on XX/XX/XXXX. With the new PIN number, I again attempted on XX/XX/XXXX to unfreeze my credit on the Experian website and finally got to a screen that showed my security freeze was temporarily removed. With that information, I called my Bank to start the process of applying for a {$26000.00} car loan and {$15000.00} cash down payment since I knew that all three credit reporting agencies had lifted our credit freezes. The Bank loan specialist that I talked with had information that showed my Experian file was still in credit freeze, the Bank attempted to reach Experian by phone while I was on hold, but could not reach them either. Next, I again attempted to reach a Experian rep by telephone at the above number and was not successful in reaching anyone, only the phone voice system. I called my Bank loan specialist again and he again went through the process of contacting Experian on my behalf. We also tried using the \" single-use PIN '' that Experian had issued to me on a previous call so that the Bank could use that to access my report, as described on Experian 's website. That single-use PIN did not work for that Bank either on XXXXxperians website or the phone system, nor did the new personal PIN that Experian had sent to me in the mail. About an hour after we hung up on our phone call on XX/XX/XXXX, the Bank specialist called me back because he had finally reached a live person at Experian and the three of us on the joint call went through the process of trying to unfreeze my report with the new PIN that they had mailed and a new single-use pin for the bank to use to get my report. None of the PINs worked at unlocking my freeze and the rep from Experian set up to mail me a new PIN for my use which would arrive in the mail in another 5-7 days because the Experian rep did not have access to that PIN either. At this point, I knew I would give up on working with my Bank to get a joint car loan with my husband, especially because we were told that the Bank only relied on credit reports from Experian and not from XXXX or from XXXX. We were still shopping for a car, found one at our local dealership that met our criteria and discussed financing through the dealership, especially checking to see which credit agencies they relied on for new credit, explaining that we had good unfrozen reports from both XXXX and XXXX, but not available from Experian. The car dealer assured us he would be able to work in those bounds and came up with a new loan package that enabled our purchase with a 41 % cash down payment. We closed on the car purchase on XX/XX/XXXX, financed with a 59 % of value car loan arranged through the dealership primarily to my husband with my name on as co-signor. A week to 10 days later, I have received notices from Experian with a new PIN number that I no longer need and a separate postcard statement that they had insufficient ID information to verify my identity and steps how I could get my credit report. I also received letters from 2 banks that showed my recent credit requests were denied because of the freeze and unavailable credit reports on Experian. I am submitting this complaint to CFPB because I am a person with good credit who had great difficulty in getting a freeze lifted from Experian, but no difficulty in getting the same result from XXXXXXXX or from XXXX. I found that Experian 's online and telephone systems were difficult to work with especially in comparison with the other two agencies. Then the issue of finding a live person to talk to at Experian, one rep was located in XXXX XXXX, added more complications when that agent did not have access to any information that would help my Bank access my report. The Experian lock-out took away my ability to purchase and finance a new car, except that my husband 's credit reports were available and I ended up as a co-signor.\n",

It has never happened. They call me constantly asking for my payment and I keep explaining that they have my extra money sitting there. Finally at the end of XX/XX/XXXX I asked them to apply the XXXX to XXXX 's payment and the extra XXXX to XXXX 's payment since they were not making good on the letter stating the money would be refunded to me. They call me on a daily basis to ask for my payment. I received a call on XX/XX/19 stating that I still owed an additional XXXX. I asked if this would make me current through XX/XX/XXXX and they stated that it would as the extra money was from the original overpayment. I paid it over the phone and the amount has come out of my bank. I received a call again today asking me for my XX/XX/XXXX payment.

( 1 ) - ( 19 ) insurance of notes and 1901.508 Servicing of insured notes outstanding with investors. The holder will endorse the insured note as follows : \" Pay to the order of the United States of America. Without recourse ''. As the facts I have stated in our contract # XXXX Conditional Acceptance for the Value/Agreement/ Counter Offer to Acceptance of Offer. The Obligation 's of public debt of the United States of America is discharged though the banks. Nation star Mortgage Services has refused to answer my questions with detailed specific answers, we will presume that there is a concealment of material of facts and that the promissory note has been altered and stolen and that I provided the money that Nation star Mortgage claims have lent to me. If you claim that there is an agreement and a loan, then you must stop concealing material facts, answer my questions, and tell me if the promissory note was recorded as a loan from me to Nation Star or the Promissory note was stolen. According to my records, the promissory note was stolen or recorded as a loan from me to Nation Star and that Nation Star never paid one cent as adequate consideration to purchase the promissory note from me creating the economics similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling. I am now demanding that you either stop concealing material facts and answer my questions if you claim that there is an agreement or that you return the stolen promissory note. If you claim that the promissory note was a loan from me to Nation Star Mortgage, I demand that you immediately repay the loan by returning the promissory note and stop the damage to me. I am hereby offering to discharge the alleged debt provided that you give specific answers to my questions regarding the alleged debt and I will payoff or discharged the alleged debt using the same specie of funds or money or money equivalent that Nation Star Mortgage used to fund the alleged loan or similar instrument thus ending all liens and interests. One of the requirements of a negotiable instrument is that the instrument must be payable for a fixed amount of money. My question is, from your point of view according to your understanding of the agreement, is money deposited recorded as a bank asset or as a bank liability? Please list all forms of money or negotiable instruments you and Nation Star Mortgage are involved in, issuing the alleged loan, use as or like or as a substitute as money or credit used to fund checks or bank drafts. Specifically, did you or Nation Star Mortgage use my promissory as a bank asset which was offset by a bank liability? Specifically was my promissory note used to fund a check or bank draft? If my promissory note was used to fund a check, then I provided the money to fund the so called loan and you never lent me one cent of your money to purchase the note from me. Therefore, the economics are similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling against me, which I never agreed to and which is not part of the agreement. According to me if you used my promissory note to fund a check, you stole my promissory note or you recorded it as a loan from me to you and you still owe me money that you never lent me. Stealing changed the cost and the risk of the transaction. I want to know specifically did you intend to create the economics similar to stealing my promissory note as part of the agreement? Please answer yes or no. If you refuse to tell me, then we have fraud in the factum, which makes you no longer the holder in due course. No title passes with a theft. Since the promissory note is forged, and no good title passes with a forged document, you are not the holder. I demand that the stolen forged promissory note now be returned or you answer all of my questions in this notice and previous notices explaining the terms and conditions of the alleged agreement concerning the economics similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling. To be a holder in due course you must perform the following 3 deeds : 1. Purchase the promissory note from me. 2. Take the promissory note in good faith using honesty, absence of malice and the absence of design to defraud or seek an unconscionable advantage ( See XXXX XXXX XXXX for good faith ) and 3. Have no notice of any defenses against payment of other claims on the promissory note. Nation Star Mortgage agreed to the following general terms and conditions of the loan agreement : 1. Nation Star Mortgage must use their money or credit as adequate consideration to purchase the agreement from me to repay the loan. 2. Nation Star Mortgage involved in the alleged loan did not accept anything of value from me that would be used to fund a check or similar instrument in approximately the amount of the alleged loan. 3. Nation Star Mortgage must follow Generally accepted accounting principles as required by CPA audit opinions. 4. The intent of the agreement is the party who funded the loan is to be repaid the money. 5. All material facts are to be disclosed in the writing agreement.6. The holder must repay the loan in the same specie of money or credit or thing of value the financial institution involved in the loan used to fund the loan check or similar instrument, thus ending all interest and liens. 7. The loan transaction does not create the economics similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling. The agreement that I entered into has the above seven elements in it. According to the bookkeeping entries, Nation Star Mortgage breached all seven basic elements of the agreement and Nation Star Mortgage and then concealed material facts of the agreement. I am demanding adequate assurance of due performance that the above seven elements are part of the loan agreement or I demand that the Nation Star Mortgage return a XXXX loan balance. The question is Why you Can not produce the promissory note? Answer is because they are a bill of exchange, legal tender and used to discharge public debt.

The International Bill of Exchange is legal tender as a national bank note, or note of a National Banking Association, by legal and/or statutory definition ( UCC 4-105, 12CFR Sec. 229.2, 210.2, 12 USC 1813 ), issued under Authority of the United States Code 31 USC 392, 5103, which officially defines this as a statutory legal tender and is issued in accordance with 31 USC 3123 and HJR 192 ( 1933 ) which establish and provide for its issuance as Public Policy in remedy for discharge of equity interest recovery on that portion of the public debt to its Principals and Sureties bearing the Obligations of THE UNITED STATES. This is a statutory remedy for equity interest recovery due the principles and sureties of the United States for discharge of lawful debts in commerce in conjunction with US obligations to that portion of the public debt it is intended to reduce. During the financial crisis of the depression in XXXX, gold, silver and real money were removed as a foundation for our financial system. In its place the substance of the American citizenry : their real property, wealth, assets and productivity that belongs to them was, in effect, pledged by the government and placed at risk as the collateral for US debt, credit and currency for commerce to function. This is well documented in the actions of Congress and the President at that time and in the Congressional debates that preceded the adoption of the reorganizational measures : Senate Document No. 43, 73rd Congress, 1st Session, stated, Under the new law the money is issued to the banks in return for Government obligations, bills of exchange, drafts, notes, trade acceptances, and bankers acceptances. The money will be worth XXXX cents on the debt because it is backed by the credit of the nation. It will represent a mortgage on all the homes and other property of all the people in the Nation. ( Which lawfully belongs to these private citizens. ) The National Debt is defined as mortgages on the wealth and income of the people of a country. ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ) Their wealth, their income. The reorganization is evidenced by : The Emergency Banking Act, XX/XX/XXXX, House Joint Resolution 192, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX public law 73-10 ) And the series of Executive Orders that surrounded them : 6073- Reopening of Banks. Embargo on Gold Payments and Exports, and Limitations on Foreign Exchange Transactions. XX/XX/XXXX 6111-Transactions in foreign exchange are permitted under Governmental Supervision. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates. XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, Congress had passed An Act to provide for the establishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an elastic currency, to afford a means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes. The Act is commonly known as the Federal Reserve Act. One of the purposes for enacting the Federal Reserve Act was : ( 3 ) to authorize hypothecation of obligations including United States bonds or other securities which Federal reserve Banks are authorized to hold under Section 14 ( a ) ; 12 USC ; ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251 Sect 14 ( a ) The term hypothecation as stated in Section 14 ( a ) of the Act is defined : 1. Banking. Offer of stocks, bonds, or other assets owned by a party other than the borrower as collateral for a loan, without transferring title. If the borrower turns the property over to the lender who holds it for safekeeping, the action is referred to as a pledge. If the borrower retains possession, but gives the lender the right to sell the property in event of default, it is a true hypothecation. 2. Securities. The pledging of negotiable securities to collateralize a brokers margin loan. The broker pledges the same securities to a bank as collateral for a brokers loan, the process is referred to as re-hypothecation. [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, pg. 228 ( XXXX ) ] As seen from the definitions, in hypothecation there is equitable risk to the actual owner. Section 16 of the current Federal Reserve Act, which is codified at 12 USC 411, declares that Federal Reserve Notes are obligations of the United States. So we see the full faith and credit of the United States, which is the substance of the American citizenry, their real property, wealth, assets and productivity that belongs to them, is thereby hypothecated and re-hypothecated by the United States to its obligations as well as to the Federal Reserve for the issuance and backing of Federal Reserve Notes, as legal tender, for all taxes, customs, and other public dues.

( ii ) On receipt of the endorsed note the Director, Finance Office, will acknowledge receipt of the note and process payment to the assignor of the par value of the note as of the date of the Treasury check. The United States can not pledge or risk the property and wealth of its private citizens, for any government purpose, without legally providing them remedy to recover what is due them on their risk. This principle is so well established in English common law and in the history of American jurisprudence. The 14th amendment provides : no person shall be deprived ofproperty without due process of law. The Courts have long ruled to have ones property legally held as collateral or surety for a debt, even when he still owns it and still has it, is to deprive him of it since it is at risk and could be lost for the debt at any time. The United States Supreme Court said, in United States v. XXXX [ 13 Wall, 623, 627 ], Private property, the Constitution provides, shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. The right of subrogation is not founded on contract. It is a creature of equity ; is enforced solely for the purpose of accomplishing the ends of substantial justice ; and is independent of any contractual relations between the parties. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX v. XXXX, 120 U.S. 287, 301-302 ( XXXX ). The rights of a surety to recovery on his risk or loss when standing for the debts of another was reaffirmed again as late as XXXX in XXXX v. XXXX XXXX. XXXX, 371 U.S. 132, when the Court said : sureties compelled to pay debts for their principal have been deemed entitled to reimbursement, even without a contractual promise And probably there are few doctrines better established XXXX XXXX XXXX, 5th edition, defines surety : One who undertakes to pay or to do any other act in event that his principal fails therein. Everyone who incurs a liability in person or estate for the benefit of another, without sharing in the consideration, stands in the position of a surety. Constitutionally, and in the laws of equity, the United States could not borrow or pledge the property and wealth of its private citizens, put at risk as collateral for its currency and credit, without legally providing them equitable remedy for recovery of what is due them. The United States government, of course, did not violate the law or the Constitution in this way in order to collateralize its financial reorganization, but did, in fact, provide such a legal remedy so that it has been able to continue on since XXXX to hypothecate the private wealth and assets of those classes of persons by whom it is owned, at risk backing the governments obligations and currency, by their implied consent, through the government having provided such remedy, as defined and codified above, for recovery of what is due them on their assets and wealth at risk. The provisions for this are found in the same act of Public Policy HJR-192, public law 73-10 that suspended the gold standard, abrogated the right to demand payment in gold, and made Federal Reserve notes for the first time legal tender, backed by the substance or credit of the nation. All US currency since that time is only credit against the real property, wealth and assets belonging to the private sovereign American people, taken and/or pledged by THE UNITED STATES to its secondary creditors as security for its obligations. Consequently, those backing the nations credit and currency could not recover what was due them by anything drawn on Federal Reserve notes without expanding their risk and obligation to themselves. Any recovery payments backed by this currency would only increase the public debt its citizens were collateral for, which an equitable remedy was intended to reduce, and in equity would not satisfy anything. And there was, as still, no longer actual money of substance to pay anybody. There are other serious limitations on our present system. Since the institution of these events, for practical purposes of commercial exchange, there has been no actual money in circulation by which debt owed from one party to another can actually be repaid. Federal Reserve Notes, although made legal tender for all debts public and private in the reorganization, can only discharge a debt. Debt must be paid with value or substance ( i.e. gold, silver, barter, labor, or a commodity ). For this reason HJR-192 ( 1933 ), which established the public policy of our current monetary system, repeatedly uses the technical term of discharge in conjunction with payment in laying out public policy for the new system.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Regarding Acct. # XXXX My ex-husband and I have been dealing with US Bank for over 15 years managing and paying an Equiline account on time each month. Once we received our divorce in XXXX the bank would not divide the loan in half because he retired in XXXX and I was still working so our attorneys told us both to pay one half the bill each month. The account has matured and we are no longer able to draw funds on it and the bill has gone from approximately {$600.00} to {$1300.00} per month. We are both unable to make this {$680.00} payment each month and the bank has encouraged us to refinance. For some strange reason we were not able to refinance with a conventional loan so they suggested we go through Loss Mitigation. We have sent in application packets with requested documents from XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX but they refuse to approve this loan. To make things worse, they have assigned a different Relationship Manager ( RM ) every month or so causing more confusion. We have had XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and now XXXX. They rarely answer the telephone when you call and when they do they won't give any concrete answers about the application status and they have never told me exactly what documents they did receive from us. They continue to ask for more and more documents from us starting from scratch. During one phone call XXXX thought my house was attached to this Equiline account when actually it is the house that my ex-husband lives in. I know I have sent in the documents requested because I have scanned them and sent them from the Public Library and it provided a scanned copy for my file. Another time I sent them from one of the local US Bank branches. I asked the RM there to look over the packet to make sure I had everything included but she would not do it ; she said she was not allowed to do so. However ; a week prior, I was there and she encouraged me to come back anytime I need their help. US Bank has exemplified poor customer service, discriminatory loan practices, unprofessional and unethical business etiquette in the 21st Century. I am appalled and there is no excuse for it. I have also experienced several other issues with US Bank regarding other account I have with them. I do not want to get into those issues right now.

      "VALUE OF S is Please advise as to how I can escalate my complaint against Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. I had been current for 36 months in a row when I was laid off of my job. I contacted Wells Fargo immediately and was told about a deferred payment plan. I agreed to enroll in the plan in XXXX and was told not to make any payments until the enrollment process completed. In XXXX, I was sent the paperwork for the program and noticed that all deferred payment would become due immediately at the conclusion of the program. This was not told to me initially back in XXXX. However, at this point, I was now over 2 months behind on my mortgage. I was advised by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage not to worry, enroll in the program, and when it concluded we would apply for a loan modification to address the deferred amount. I did as advised but then, due to the glitch in Wells Fargo 's software, was told that I didnt have sufficient income to qualify. I knew that had to be incorrect and appealed time after time, only to receive the same answer. Finally, my house went into foreclosure. Because of this glitch in their software, I have lost my home along with many other homeowners. I have filed complaints and written many letters but no one has helped. I filed a complaint with you and Wells Fargo supposedly did an investigation. Their response was that they can not do anything to correct the situation because my house was sold in a foreclosure sale. That is exactly my complaint.

He had been called supposing from the SSA and they had told him there were charges on him and that the social security number had been used for drug trafficking and money laundering. He was so scared of having to go to prison and not being able to see our daughter and me that he believed the story. Additionally, he was told not to tell anyone about this because else it would go public. He was tracked for a week and when they found out he was about to transfer all our savings from XXXX to here ( {$260000.00} ). The scammers told him that he needed to send the money to a safe account in XXXX. He would then get the money with his new Social Security number which would not have any charges on it because they now were sure that he was not involved in any drug trafficking. We already had the contract for a house and the money from XXXX was supposed to be the down payment. Of course, no money came, and my husband broke down and we had to cancel the house contract. We reported this to the police and the FBI, but nothing is happening. Also, the involded banks ( Wellsfargo and XXXX XXXX ) are not very cooperative. {$30000.00} USD had been transferred from our Wells Fargo account to the fraud account in XXXX. We had just opened the account, transferred some money into the account and the bank knew that we were planning to buy a house. How could they have not asked for a reason for us to transfer all our money to a known money scamming country? Why are there no extra security checks in place for these types of suspicious transactions? My husband was blackmailed, and it should have rung all the bells within the bank. We have asked the bank to try to stop the transaction and get the money back but they said that they had tried but not succeeded and that it was our own fault.

So the deposits were unable to be set up until beginning of XXXX. But this was after calling Wells Fargo, and them repeatedly denying my inquiries. Also, blocks on accessing their website from outside the U.S. presumably. I explained to the agent that my promotion required my direct deposits but he said that I needed to come into a bank branch which is physically impossible. Still, I deposited values, equaling over {$29000.00} during the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, which meets the requirements for deposits within 150 days over 3 consecutive months. The bank representative XXXX XXXX in customer care at first told me that they were not made within first 3 months ( not as promotion period stated ). When I corrected her that I had until XX/XX/XXXX to be within 150 days, she stated that {$3000.00} was not made in XXXX, but the promotion states cumulative monthly total, and she refused to honor it. To beware : 1- Wells Fargo prevented me from setting up direct deposit through their \" safety measures '' while I was out of the country, disallowing me from quickly satisfying terms. 2- Wells Fargo read an absolute ( or partial ) sum of one month to say I did not qualify, instead of the cumulative sum that they placed in their offer.

The card advertises that one can set up their account in 3 easy steps. After adding my ss # I was directed to customer service and asked to upload my documents. They wanted me to upload pictures of my drivers licence, s.s card and proof of address just to activate my card. I was told it would then take up to 14 business days to allow me to have full access. I told them thats ridiculous and why are they asking me to verify these things for a card not yet activated or attached to me at all whatsoever at that point. I felt they were trying to steal my identity using my money to do so. Eventually 3 days later I contacted a supervisor who told me she would just refund my {$300.00} minus a {$15.00} dollar fee for the refund. She said it would come to my address in a paper check. I verified my address and verbally gave my information over the phone. It matched up with my previous reported info they had in they're system. I was told just wait for it to come in the mail via ground shipping in just a few days. 2 weeks later XX/XX/20 I called back to find out that the check was sent to an address that does not match mine and my name was mispelled as well.

I was told it would be fixed and I can call back for the update in 3 business days. Its again been weeks. Everyday is a struggle trying to get through to somone now. I can't get past the automated system to a live operator. The automated system requires me to enter my card # but my card was never activated therefore its not valid. The system automatically disconnects once my card number pings back invalid. On XX/XX/20 I was able to reach a supervisor for netspend who literally hung up on me when I asked why a financial institution would send my money to the wrong address and misspell my name when the very info required for verification is indeed correct in their system already on file from a previous prepaid netspend card!

I was notified of the returned payment by Synchrony but NEVER notified that more than one returned payment would result in my account closure and loss of points earned. I revised the payment account number but this was also returned. I contacted my credit union and was informed I have a limit of 6 transactions per month from the account, which I was unaware of. This is why they refused the electronic payment. I then logged in to the Synchrony website to revise the payment method, and saw it said \"this account has been closed.\" I then received an email from XXXX XXXX asking if I closed this account. I NEVER got notice OR warning from Synchrony Banana Republic Visa that a second returned payment would result in immediate closure of my account and loss of points. I called Synchrony and was told, sorry it's a term (hidden someone in the fine print of course) yes two returned payment your account is closed automatically with no opportunity to reinstate it. Please note, my account was in good standing and my minimum balance was paid so the two returned payments are the sole reason my account was closed.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is In connection with Ally Financial : this company has been horrible to work with. In the last year since purchasing the vehicle, repeated requests for statements so that we could make timely payments were ignored. We got fed up and refinanced the car through XXXX in XX/XX/2019. We were provided with a verbal 10 day payoff. XXXX paid that amount and added {$200.00} to the payoff as a pad. Ally claims we still owe $ 10+ over and above the payoff amount and refuses to release title to the car. We have sent checks to the payoff address provided, one for {$10.00}, one for {$11.00} and one for {$15.00} and Ally to date has refused to apply payments. Ally has also refused our several requests for a complete breakdown of how the payoff issued from XXXX was applied.

      "VALUE OF S is I have monitoring services with all three credit bureaus which allow me to unlock and lock my credit report, since I am a continuous victim of identity theft. On XX/XX/XXXX, someone unlocked my credit report without my consent and then called and changed addresses, phone numbers, added accounts, credit cards opened, rented a place with my social security number. When I called to see how my credit report was unlocked when I had locked it back in XXXX, they kept transferring me to one department to another and manager to manager. Nobody could answer my question. I was left having to clean up the mess when I am paying them a monthly fee so that I and I alone can unlock and lock my report.

      "VALUE OF S is In applying for a pre-qualification mortgage, I was asked if I would allow an inquiry into my credit I did not want this. So I backed out before completing any further. 5 minutes later, I received a hard inquiry on my credit. I was then told that they tested this out themselves and that it wasn't possible. I asked if they had a system in place to verify this and they said yes. If that we're the case, they would know for sure that I didn't consent to my credit being inquired upon. They said that they tested it from their end and could not replicate my scenario and that was enough to prove I did allow them to check my credit. This was a fraudulent inquiry and it was never approved by me. The way they have the form setup to be used is not secure enough if I can back out of their process without a notification asking me or notifying me of what may or may not happen. There is no way they could have verified I allowed them to access my credit. I know this for a fact. I did the application with someone else and they saw this too. In addition to all of this and after going through the steps again, I believe there are more issues to address like the way they advertise a pre-qualification and then ask for a credit inquiry halfway through the page. This is why I backed out in the first place.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Not enough information to verify debt : In XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of 2019 I requested an investigation be conducted by the credit bureaus of an alleged debt owed by me in the amount of {$730.00}. ( account # XXXX ) A proper investigation according to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) requires PHYSICAL verification of an original signed consumer contract and not an electronic or E-oscar verification under which a lot of investigations are being conducted. This software has limitations when it comes to conducting a proper investigation of records to which I have recieved verified as accurate without recieving the documentation that I have requested which is a violation of federal law.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is First, I am a XXXX year old woman who was targeted in an XXXX scam. There is a Synchrony Bank Account/Amazon account that appeared on all 4 credit bureaus in mid to late XXXX. I noticed them after ordering my free annual credit reports and started disputes to all the bureaus, however, I was not able to get all documentation to them in a timely manner as I had to be treated for XXXX XXXX. The original number that appeared on this account is XXXX on all four bureaus attached is the account number as it shows on the XXXX Report. Synchrony Bank Fraud Department sent me correspondence requesting the identity theft information in late XXXX early XXXX which I filled out and returned them that included the two police report numbers they asked for. A few weeks later I received from them a letter advising that they were removing these accounts from all four bureaus. Synchrony Bank removed the first Synchrony/Amazon Bank account but then in an underhanded and sneaky way opened a new account in name with a new number and reinserted on all 4 bureaus and started reporting to that number. I found out when speaking go XXXX Fraud Department when I was asked if there were two accounts. I said I never had any accounts and she said there were two Amazon accounts. II have never had an account with Synchrony/Amazon. The new partial number is XXXX which appears on the XXXX report and probably all bureaus. I received the number today, XX/XX/XXXX in correspondence from XXXX. ( Attached ) Synchrony Bank continues to reinsert and report accounts that were opened in my name on line by people impersonating me. This account look to be account that was opened online after I gave XXXX XXXX who I worked with me and was a friend of the family and had been in and out of my house on a regular basis and whom I had given three used phones and a tablet along with other used items in XXXX not knowing we he actually lived in XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX on the XXXX XXXX and was in the US on a work permit. I have had a checking account at XXXX I closed out in XXXX because XXXX was never able to stop all the fraud/identity theft on my checking accounts and consistently shutting down my debit card without notifying me and sending a new card because of fraudulent activity by other people who had stolen and used the card number. There was always money missing from my account and XXXX could not tell me why. On XX/XX/XXXX I once again disputed this account as being identity theft and provided a XXXX County Sheriff 's Department Police report ( attached ) regarding a harassment/scam incident I had been experiencing with the XXXX XXXX man who I met and worked with beginning XXXX, XXXX and until I resigned in XX/XX/XXXX. I did not know at the time he was only here on a work permit and travels back and forth from XXXX to the US collecting used items to take back and sell. He misleads people when he is here and tells them the used items are for the needy in XXXX. I found out in XXXX per the first attached Sheriff 's Report which is Harassment and where he and his family were trying to scam me out of money. Each and every time I told them NO the harassment would escalate until there was Sheriff at my door in XX/XX/XXXX the date of the first report. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX approached me at Lowe 's and requested used clothing and electronics ( i.e, used unlocked phones and tablets. I gave him clothes and other items and also a XXXX phone, an XXXX XXXX XXXX phone, an XXXX phone and a tablet. I don't remember the brand of the tablet, but they were all unlocked and reset to factory settings. I thought resetting the to factory settings would make them safe but was later advised it DOES NOT clear the memory and your personal information can still be obtained. I found later in a conversation with XXXX XXXX he shipped these things back to XXXX in XXXX in a container that contained cars, and other things but also included the used clothes and electronic items. Once he took these things back the phones memory were broken into and all my personal information was taken which included all banking information, including passwords, verbal passwords as well, all my email addresses, were taken, phone contacts, everything that I stored on my phone in my XXXX password directory. He had access to my XXXX account and set up 3 accounts in my name which I have since had taken down. I have reported him to the Department of Immigration and sent emails to Lowe 's as they were allowing him not only to work there but to solicit customers and employees for used items and especially electronics as being distributed as items for the needy but he was actually selling them. During the early to mid day on XX/XX/XXXX, I had two strange calls one to my home phone and one to my cell phone both were the same XXXX man asking questions. I didn't answer any questions, I just hung up. in the early evening I received emails from my home phone account provider that my password had been changed. I called to find out what was going on and to correct it yet someone changed it again. The same evening at about XXXX I received a call from XXXX XXXX Department who told me there was suspicious activity taking place on my account. XXXX XXXX had been put on my checking account and a spoof card had been bought using my checking account in the amount of XXXX. I was also advised that this same XXXX man or maybe a woman had called in impersonating me and spoke directly with XXXX employees about my accounts a day or so earlier. These are the same people who opened the Synchrony/Amazon Account. XX/XX/XXXX I filed a dispute with all bureaus with included the first police report ( attached ) again only to be told I needed a different report and that Synchrony Bank would not remove them. OF COURSE SYNCHRONY BANK WOULD HAVE MY INFORMATION AS THEY HAVE SPOKEN DIRECTLY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO STOLE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION BY IMPERSONATING ME ONLINE OR BY PHONE USING INFORMATION TAKEN FROM THESE ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND OPENED THIS ACCOUNTS IN MY NAME. On XX/XX/XXXX, I again disputed these accounts and sent all bureaus a new report ( attached ) Fraudulent Use of Identification and Impersonation regarding these same XXXX who impersonated me and who spoke directly to XXXX when they called in to XXXX number and spoke with XXXX personnel and opened up and used these accounts using my information obtained from these phones and tablets and opening the Synchrony/Amazon Account as well. I do not have a complete account number only partial numbers from the credit reports as I have never had these cards/accounts. Synchrony Bank needs to provide me with applications filled out and signed by me allowing Synchrony Bank to open up these accounts/cards. If it was opened online why didn't they gave it finished and opened up in person and where is my authorization to open a new account in my name by Synchrony Bank. Unless this can be provided Synchrony must remove these from all bureaus. Simply saying these accounts belong to me when others have all my personal information at their disposal and are using is not enough since Synchrony Bank allowed these fraudulent accounts to opened up by people impersonating me online or over the phone without contacting me first before opening them yet this is what happened. It appears these accounts were dumped as soon as these people realized my checking account had been closed and moved and when I changed all my personal information including my XXXX account containing my personal information. Provided the application you said I filled and signed not an online or phone application that can be done by anyone impersonating you after they have stolen your phone identity and all your personal information and is using it. Also provide the application I filled out and signed on the new account you opened in my name and are reporting to. Also provide the letter you sent me advising both Synchrony/Care Credit and Synchrony/Amazon accounts were closed. I have my copy, I want to see what lie you tell about that since you opened a new account in my name.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is My complaint is about Wells Fargo Bank ( WFB ). I am the sole heir of my father 's home. My attorney already transferred the deed into my name, per the terms of the trust. WF has received this information and has confirmed that they have it. I have been trying to get WFB to put my name on the mortgage and remove my mom and dad, since they are both deceased. I spoke to XXXX at WFB today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and they refuse to do so and indicate that I must meet their assumption or refinance qualifications. I have been paying this mortgage for the past eight months and my understanding is that I do not need to \" qualify '' if I am the child of the deceased and will be living in the home. I mentioned the law does not require an Ability to Pay provision in this case. WFB said that it used to be that way, but that Dodd Frank of 2010 changed and I would have to qualify as if taking on a new mortgage or refinance. I found 12 CRF Part 1026 RIN 3170-ZA00 dated XX/XX/XXXX that addresses this issue in detail. I found another article that confirms this as well. Both are attached. As far as I can tell, WFB staff are incorrect. I feel that they are deliberately violating the rules to try and get me into a new loan, complete with a bunch of new fees. This is after months of run around from them.The only reason I would take on the existing WFB mortgage is for ease and to not have a hard pull on my credit report. I would have no problem qualifying for a mortgage or refinance on my own, but I would seek much better terms than this bank offers. If WFB refuses to work with me, I will simply take my business elsewhere and get a new mortgage. However, what about all of the people who may not have this option? It isn't right that they are not afforded their options because WFB doesn't understand the rules.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is In XX/XX/XXXX I began my undergraduate studies with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA and completed this program in XX/XX/XXXX.

I was also enrolled at the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, for the for their graduate level XXXX XXXX Certificate Program, these credits were later applied to a graduate degree in project management with the XXXX XXXX XXXX inXX/XX/XXXX, I completed this program in XX/XX/XXXX. During this time frame I used part of my XX/XX/XXXX for these programs along with student loans. I had a series of health issues that were not resolved while on active duty that were later compounded that required me to request a deferment/forbearance of my student loans due to my inability to work. Some were granted to my knowledge whereas others were not, which I continued to resolve. Upon careful review and further evaluation by the VA my XXXX rating was increased to 100 %, which qualified me for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) program for my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX DOE directed XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX to suspend collection activities on my student loans until they could determine my eligibility for discharge. Effective XX/XX/XXXX, the DOE had approved my discharge of the federal student loans on the basis of my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

      "VALUE OF S is Borrower is requesting the help of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to assist him in having his mortgage company correct several accounting errors in their ledgers, that do not conform to the Loan Agreement Agreement. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Borrower, had a Mortgage loan held by Bank of America ( BOA ) with a beginning principal balance of {$430000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, BOA transferred the loan to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) for servicing, which at that time of the transfer had a balance of {$420000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX entered into a Loan Adjustment Agreement ( LAA ) with the Borrower. Shortly after receiving XXXX first monthly statement, Borrower noticed that the statement did not accurately reflect the terms of the LAA. Upon noticing the inaccuracies, Borrower contacted XXXX numerous times to ask them to correct their monthly statements to no avail. On XXXX XXXX, the loan was transferred back to Bank of America. Borrower also contacted BOA on numerous occasions to ask them to correct their ledger to no avail. Contrary to the LAA, XXXX reduced the original unpaid principal balance of {$420000.00} by only {$24000.00}, and therefore incorrectly calculated the new principal balance as {$400000.00}. Pursuant to the LAA, the original principal balance of {$420000.00} should have been reduced by {$27000.00}, and the new principal balance should have been correctly reflected on XXXX statements and ledger as {$400000.00}. Also, contrary to the LAA, XXXX statements indicate that XXXX added {$51000.00} to their incorrectly calculated new principal balance, and that XXXX intends that the {$51000.00} be paid as a balloon payment on the maturity date. But, according the LAA, interest should be waived on {$51000.00} of the XXXX XXXX, and if the Borrower fails to make timely payment on the final {$51000.00} of the principal, then the waived interest on the {$51000.00} becomes due as a balloon payment on the maturity date. Also, XXXX statements and ledger incorrectly show a 4.5 % interest rate on the loan, but the LAA clearly states that the interest rate on the loan is fixed at 3.5 % for the remaining life of the loan. Because of XXXX deviations from the LAA, XXXX ledger shows that, for the 28 months that the loan was with XXXX, the original principal balance was reduced by {$24000.00} and that the Borrower made total principal payments of only {$8800.00} ; for a combined total reduction of the original principal of {$32000.00}. Therefore, at the time the loan was transferred back to BOA for servicing, XXXX miscalculated the principal balance as {$390000.00} instead of the actual {$370000.00}.\n",

Experian, you state that you opened a \" reinvestigation '' in XX/XX/XXXXwhen I have continually asked for my bankruptcy information to be updated for nearly 2 years now from your company. I simply stated in my requests to you that if you were unable to update the information accurately then please delete it. I am in no way accepting your falsehoods as accuracy. I have contacted each company listed in my original complaint and verified that they have my account updated as discharged in chapter XXXX bankruptcy. THIS WAS DONE AFTER XX/XX/2017 AND BEFORE XX/XX/2017. In other words this was verified PRIOR to my contacting your company. I have sent every item of documentation you have requested. The only thing I have not done to date is sue your company. If you are stating on record these data furnishers are purposely supplying you with false information then I should have been promoted to take legal action against them. However in this case the data furnishers are assuring me that it is in fact EXPERIAN who is supplying false data. I no longer have any active accounts with any of these creditors. Updating my information accurately has nothing to do with signature slips as you noted in your CFPB response. It is simply updating information accurately which YOU ARE IN FACT OBLIGED TO DO by LAW, FCRA SPECIFICALLY. You are blatantly refusing to update my information and have caused me severe hardship by doing this. Therefore you have left no further choice but lawsuit. To date I have sent you discharge papers, bankruptcy schedules, creditor letters, and CFPB complaints. I will seek every damage and remedy afforded to me under the law and am more than confident I will prevail. I have every piece of documentation including your recent blatant regard for the federal laws that protect us both. Thank you\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Best Buy Credit Services, Citi Bank. Morally Bankrupt? First off, I think it is safe to say a {$60.00} fee on {$500.00} line of credit is outrageous. I think this fee is purposely more than the minimum payment so Citi can accrue interest on it by spreading the payment out over multiple months for customers enrolled in autopay. In XXXX I purchased a laptop on the CC to help with online classes I was taking at the time.I made several other purchases over a 6 month time frame. In XX/XX/XXXX I paid an annual fee and asked for the account to be closed, the customer service rep convinced me to keep the account open, as a favor she would reduce the amount I owed. To paraphrase, she explained it was in my best interest to keep the account open since the fee was taken care of. Understanding that closing a credit card could harm my credit, I enrolled in auto pay at that time. In XX/XX/XXXX an automatic payment was applied to the account for the XXXX annual fee but not for the total amount, I switched banks between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The next month the payment failed. I have another account with Citi that I was current on this entire time. I called in late XXXX to close the account and I thought this brought me to a XXXX balance but apparently I was mistaken. As of XX/XX/XXXX my credit report reflects the account is closed by the creditor. Late payment of over 90 days balance of {$150.00} that Citi forgave and did not send to a collection agency. As a result my credit score was dinged about 80 points from around 705 to XXXX Citi employee XXXX of Best Buy Credit Services team # XXXX denies that it was predatory to offer to reduce my balance if I would consider keeping the card open in XXXX. Citi also denies that a {$60.00} fee for a {$500.00} line of credit is predatory because I could have requested a credit line increase at any time. Citi claims that as a young person I am a credit risk and thus a {$60.00} fee is justified.\n",

Experian blacked out my phone number on the credit report so that XXXX needs to get the freeze removed so that they can see the phone number to call me.

How does the government allow a credit bureau to have so much control over a persons life????? There is no accountability with these bureaus. XXXX is associated with XXXX, so XXXX made a ton money off people when they had a breach and they weren't accoutable, in fact since they own XXXX, they made a ton of money off the XXXX breach.

During this time I had to not only pay the mortgage and utilities at my home and pay rent somewhere else. This caused a great financial burden on me because I couldnt afford it. I fell behind on the mortgage. Since then, I have been asking to have my loan reinstated and put the past unpaid payments on the back of my loan. I have had a mediation with Bank of Americas Attorney. I have submitted the documents they are asking only to find out that Bank of America was not reviewing the documents. And after I kept calling Bank of America, I was told by Customer Relations that an underwriter kept denying my loan stating that my income could not be verified. They are not telling the truth because Im on XXXX and they have a copy of my awards letter. I was also told that the underwriter stopped reviewing my loan because he/she they questioned my XX/XX/XXXX taxes. Im having concerns about that because I have never been audited by IRS and the underwriter has never asked for an explanation.

      "VALUE OF S is I am being forced to file this Complaint because Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, hereinafter referred to as Ocwen, refuses to abide by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, hereinafter referred to as the FDCPA and the California Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, hereinafter referred to as the Rosenthal Act. I took out a loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Due to a financial hardship in the Summer of XXXX, I fell behind in my scheduled monthly payments. While in default an Assignment of Deed of Trust was executed on XX/XX/XXXX that purportedly granted all beneficial interest in the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. At the time this assignment was executed, the debt was contractually due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. While still in default and due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment, the debt was purportedly transferred or assigned again to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee for a Trust on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, I had no knowledge these alleged transfers took place. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Ocwen informing me that the servicing of my debt obligation was being transferred to them effective XX/XX/XXXX. At the time Ocwen purportedly acquired the mortgage servicing, the debt was contractually due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. Over the past two years, I have learned that pursuant to the FDCPA and the Rosenthal Act, Ocwen and XXXX as Trustee are \" debt collectors '' and not \" creditors ''. They are attempting to collect on the debt and due to non-payment are threatening to proceed with a nonjudicial action to dispossess me from my home without the legal right or authority to do so in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692f ( 6 ) and California Civil Code 1788.17. Despite numerous letters to them, they have failed to validate the debt and have failed to provide me with any documentation to demonstrate they have the legal ability to attempt to collect the debt, collect the debt, or enforce the power of sale contained in the deed of trust. In fact in a XX/XX/XXXX letter to me, Ocwen acknowledged that is no one single owner of the account and that XXXX does not own the account. In reading the newly published U.S. Supreme Court ruling on XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, the Court confirmed that if a consumer disputes the debt and the amount owed, a debt collector must \" cease collection '' until it \" obtains verification of the debt '' and mails a copy to the debtor. Verification of the debt does not mean a copy of the loan documents. Although I have taken legal action against them, they have not stopped their collection and enforcement activities. I am filing this Complaint to make the CFPB aware of their wrongful and illegal actions. The California Supreme Court has confirmed that a borrower is not entitled to pay an entity that is without the legal right and authority to collect and is enforce. In California only a creditor, or an agent of the creditor, may attempt to collect a debt or collect a debt and/or initiate and complete a foreclosure action. Based on information and belief, I believe Ocwen and XXXX are not creditors nor are they representatives of my true creditor. Falsely representing that the foreclosure documents are legal process is prohibited and misleading and is in violation of California Civil Code 1788.16. Ocwen and XXXX are engaging in acts that are causing substantial harm not only to me but to California consumers and taxpayers. They are continually attempting to collect a debt that is not due or owed to them. Immediate action must be taken to stop them from engaging in unfair competition. Their conduct is unlawful, unfair and deceptive. They are blatantly disregarding the FDCPA and the Rosenthal Act among other federal and state laws they are mandated to abide by. Ocwen and XXXX as Trustee are not exempt from abiding by these statutes and must be held accountable for their misconduct.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I attempted twice to set their monthly reward program parameter with my B of A issued corporate card. As I traveled on business I attempted four times in total to set my online account access each time resetting my password with the help of their security featured text codes and every single time the log in card is being rejected. The phone number listed on their online support line ( XXXX ) is invalid as the automated messaging system is repeatedly requiring to input the account number ( I did ) with every single prompt selection and it is unable to forward the call to the online operator from that dept. Instead it automatically re-routes the call to their regular customer service that is ... ... ... .unable to reset the online system access and it is unable to offer an assistance with rewards program selection category. Why the CSR is unable to help customer with selection of the rewards category is beyond me as, for example with XXXX, the category can be selected with only one quick of the mouse without even logging into the system. I believe the B of A is purposefully setting up the system this way so it doesn't need to pay the rewards accrued in the use of the card. I frankly do not believe that the bank is that incompetent to not be able to set up such simple function as rewards category selection by a simple help from the CSR if their system is unable to process it online.\n",

I reiterated to them that the amount owed was not my debt and that they should close the account and remove this delinquent status from my credit report.Since speaking with XXXX, I continued to monitor my credit report(s) and then decided to put my dispute with them in writing via certified mail on XX/XX/XXXX. During this time the amount owed grew to $XXXX. I requested validation, that was competent evidence bearing my signature, showing that I have (or ever had) some contractual obligation to pay them. I further requested that if they could not validate the debt, they must have all credit reporting agencies delete the entry.XXXX responded on XX/XX/XXXX where they listed the account identifier (account number) as XXXX and stated that my return address does not match the address in their records and that they needed additional information to respond to my request.After reviewing my credit report(s) for XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed a comment under the XXXX entry that stated, Account closed at consumer's request and dispute investigation completed; consumer disagrees. I wrote to XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX asking for evidence as well as the name, address, and telephone number of each person who personally verified the alleged account so I could inquire about the process since they failed to present any proof bearing my signature. I received no response to date, and they have since reported that I owe $XXXX. The Payment History for this account starts at the month of XX/XX/XXXX and is marked C for collection. No other payment history is listed before XXXX although the report states that the account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX and the highest balance at one point was $XXXX.

( 2 ) The false representation of ( A ) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt ; or ( B ) any services rendered or compensation which may be lawfully received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt.

Working with Lakeview XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not respond to e-mails, or phone calls in a timely manner. This was for a VA Streamline refinance in which they reached out to us to initiate. Our mortgage closing date was delayed significantly, due to no response/contact after all documents were ready for closing, which caused us to incur late fees with our previous mortgage company, and when asked if should call XXXX XXXX XXXX, we were advised no. Speaking with XXXX XXXX XXXX they stated it is standard for loan officers to call or advise consumers to call and they would waive the fee. We asked approximately six times across both personnel to ensure our Escrow came back to us, via phone, e-mail and official documentation. On XXXX XXXX we spoke with XXXX directly to understand what the current delay was and ensure our election referencing the escrow was still in consideration and he assured us that our escrow would come back. We have documents from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that stated that XXXX contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, the next day, and explicit asked for a second payoff letter TO INCLUDE the escrow in the payoff ( what we explicitly reminded him we did not want and he acknowledged the day before ). Further, the timeline from initiation to closing was completely unacceptable for a streamline refinance and was further compounded by the amount of phone calls and e-mails that went unanswered by XXXX XXXX. Post closing we sent 3 follow up emails to both personnel with a requested response and did not receive one. We will continue to submit complaints with all organizations to include the XXXX until we have a full break down of all 4 estimates we received and why our wishes were directly dismissed without any valid responses.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is An insurance claim for roof damage was submitted on lender based insurance, after a storm, in XXXX.The mortgage was sold out to Shellpoint before the claim was completed. The mortgage was delinquent at that time due to my mothers illness. My mother passed away after the mortgage buy out. I did not have knowledge that the claim would continue after my mothers passing. Shellpoint agreed to let me ( her daughter ) assume the loan. In XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint contacted me for the first time about this insurance claim from XXXX. I supplied all the required documents and began to feel that I was being given the run around. Shellpoint would claim they received some documents but not others even though they were sent in the same email or the roofers insurance had expired, etc. The roofing company also contacted Shellpoint after Shellpoint continued to say the paperwork from the company was not correct. I was told, by Shellpoint, to contact three different insurance agencies ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for information on the claim even though Shellpoint had access to this information the whole time. After speaking with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, I learned Shellpoint had received about half the claim amount ( {$2000.00} ) at the time of the mortgage buy out and the remainder was available as recoverable depreciation that required action on the claim in a certain amount of time. After contacting Shellpoint, regarding this information from XXXX XXXX, I was told the funds had been placed in a restricted escrow account from the time of the mortgage buy out and I had lost any capacity to recover the depreciation.I believe the only reason Shellpoint ever informed me of the claim funds was because of the loan assumption. XXXX released the first insurance payment of XXXX dollars on XXXX, XXXX. The next disbursement would be when 50 percent of roof was complete. I informed Shellpoint no one can start a roof repair through a roofing company with only XXXX dollars. I asked that all the funds be released. Shellpoint said this was not an option because the loan was delinquent at the time of Insurance claim 5 years ago so Shellpoint had to allocate funds in this manner to assure the funds were used to improve the property. So Shellpoint doesnt trust me with the lump sum of XXXX XXXX dollars of claim funds but they agreed to let me assume the much larger mortgage note. I have received annual escrow reports over the years and never to my knowledge were the claim funds represented on any report. I believe Shellpoint thought the property would be foreclosed on and Shellpoint intended to keep the insurance claim funds. Due to this extended situation, the home has continued to suffer related damage. Had Shellpoint been transparent and communicated with me the roof could have been repaired years ago. I have contacted Shellpoint on numerous occasions including but not limited to the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX was the Shellpoint insurance contact.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I have made disputes to XXXX to delete medical collection accounts that are displaying medical information in the original creditor name on the credit reports where the data furnishers refused to protect my private medical information. My private medical information has been compromised. The law under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act Section 412 ( amendment to FCRA ) indicates that this information should be protected. Before all the disputes I had a 3rd party access my credit report and they started reading me medical collections and I was hurt by this and asked them to stop as it reminded me of the bad medical situations. Additionally, I felt hurt that 3rd parties could see this. This brought me to research why it's legal for this to be on the report in this way. Turns out that it isn't legal per the above mentioned laws. I have had no cooperation from the collection agencies and made multiple disputes with XXXX, including an XX/XX/XXXX dispute through the CFPB about XXXX not exercising oversight over the collection agencies regarding protecting medical information. The data furnishers ( collection agencies ) have refused to protect my private medical information and have compromised my medical information. The medial collection accounts are currently as of the day of this report, displaying what should be protected medical information, therefore are continuing to compromise my medical information per the above mentioned laws and refuse after repeated disputes to correct this alleged illegality. Previously a dispute was made through the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX. These collection agencies ( data furnishers ) received a copy of that CFPB report via the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX dispute investigation. XXXX confirmed to me that the CFPB report was attached to the dispute that sent to each data furnisher. Sadly, they responded to XXXX by only verifying the status and balance and did not respond at all to the issue of medical privacy that was very detailed in my CFPB report. I have spoken to collection agencies on the phone and was disrespected and was given the impression that all that mattered was what they say I owe and otherwise they seem to have indicated that nothing else matters, including the privacy of my medical information.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/XXXX I received an escrow analysis. The company showed a shortage and is attempting to increase my mortgage payment by about {$250.00}. The reason there is such a significant increase is due to the company paying my property taxes in full versus bi annual installments. They were paying in full because in XX/XX/XXXX I found they failed to make my tax payment putting me delinquent in my tax payment. I contacted customer service to have my taxes changed to bi annual payment and a new escrow analisys completed because of the original company error. This contact was made on XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed that the payment could not be changed because my county offered a discount for full payment. I contacted my county, this was a lie. I called again and it was escalated to a manager that followed up and said I would receive a letter sometime in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXXand I could change to bi annual payments at that time. Finding this unacceptable is called again. Representative XXXX said she would look in to it further and call back within 48 hours. No call back. I again have hours into fixing a problem created by this company and have no answers.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is We are filing this complaint against our servicer, RoundPoint Mortgage. We requested assistance with our mortgage payments due to unemployment, and was informed by RoundPoint Mortgage that we filled out a Uniform Borrower Assistance Form. We complied and returned the form on XX/XX/XXXX. We kept in touch with RoundPoint Mortgage throughout the process. Later on, on XX/XX/XXXX, additional documents were requested by RoundPoint Mortgage by XXXX XXXX, and they were faxed to her on XX/XX/XXXX. We received an \" Evaluation Summary '' dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that we had been approved for FHA 's Making Home Affordable Modification program. In addition, RoundPoint Mortgage included paperwork with these forms dated XX/XX/XXXX, for a letter of agreement for a trial period of 4 payments in the amount of {$1500.00}, due on the XXXX of each month starting XX/XX/XXXX, and ending with the 4th and final payment of the trial period on XX/XX/XXXX. The letter requested that we sign if we agreed to the terms sign and return the forms by XX/XX/XXXX, and we did sign them on XX/XX/XXXX, and returned the forms the same day. The payments were made according to the terms for the entire trial period. We called to speak with our \" point of contact '' ( XXXX XXXX ) until we couldn't reach her any longer and had to settle for \" the next available agent '' on a regular basis to get an update to the finalization of the modified loan agreement. We continued to receive billing statements that we were behind on our mortgage, but when we would call in about the statements, many times we would reach XXXX and he would tell us not to worry about the statements, and that they would be corrected when RoundPoint Mortgage finished \" updating our account '' with the information from the documents they had received from us, and that we were to continue to make the modified payments of {$1500.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a XXXX envelope from RoundPoint Mortgage with the \" Loan Modification Agreement '' for us to sign and have notarized. We signed the forms, had them notarized and returned them via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. We kept in touch with RoundPoint Mortgage for updates to the finalization of the \" Loan Modification Agreement. '' We received forms dated XX/XX/XXXX, about a week or so later, stating that we would find \" a fully executed copy of the Loan Modification Agreement dated XX/XX/XXXX. '' We continued to contact RoundPoint Mortgage about our account not being updated, and when would the account reflect the new terms. When we reached the next agent available, again it would be XXXX sometimes, and he stated like others before and after him, that we should ignore the billing statements and that he sent an \" escalation request '' to his manager, supervisor or someone in that capacity. This continued through XXXX, XXXX and then in XXXX we received a letter stating that we were behind two months in our mrotgage payments. I called, XX/XX/XXXX, and was connected to XXXX. I believe it was at this time that XXXX told me that there was a new modified payment and that there was a shortage in payments for the XXXX and XXXX mortgage payments. Since I was still paying {$1500.00} instead of {$1500.00} according to him, there was a difference of {$26.00} for each of the two months in question. We paid the difference of {$52.00} to bring the account back up to date. I also asked XXXX why was it taking so long to correct the statements. I stated that I felt that someone dropped the ball, but he said instead that no one dropped the ball on either end, but that there were a few things that needed to be updated. It was wasn't until about a two weeks later that XXXX told me that it had been a mistake ( s ) made on their end, ( RoundPoint Mortgage ), that was the cause of the stall with the updating of our account. In addition, XXXX stated that we need to keep making the modified loan agreement payments of {$1500.00} and he was noting the account. Then around the second week of XX/XX/XXXX, we receive a phone call from RoundPoint Mortgage about a lien being on the home and this is what was an issue, and that we needed to fill out a \" Non-Identity Affidavit. '' We did on XX/XX/XXXX and mailed and/or emailed it back with the requested proof from court to verify that there was a mistaken identity issue, and sent both documents back to RoundPoint Mortgage the same day. We continued to stay in contact with RoundPoint Mortgage on a bi-monthly basis and it was almost a month after they asked us to give them two weeks to get everything in order, that they tell us when we call in XX/XX/XXXX, that they sent in another \" escalation request. '' The representative stated that they were making a note on the account, and to continue to make the modified loan payments of {$1500.00}. Recently, we received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX from RoundPoint Mortgage that we have been granted a \" Loan Forbearance Plan '' and that we are behind {$9900.00}. It included a request for us to sign the Forbearance forms and return by XX/XX/XXXX. We signed and returned the forms on XX/XX/XXXX. I called on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke to a representative that told me we had to pay the late payments and the new mortgage amount of {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, even though we were offered and accepted a Modified Loan Agreement in XX/XX/XXXX, and it was recorded with the county in XX/XX/XXXX. We were given the excuses of an \" early payment during the modified payment schedule '' and that \" the debt wasn't reaffirmed before the debt was discharged '' as to why the modified loan agreement was, with no prior explanation prior to RoundPoint Mortgage finalizing the Modified Loan Agreement back in XXXX of XX/XX/XXXXwith the county.\n",

Mind you we don't qualify for this XXXX increase, nor were we informed that it would increase that much, nor have we been offered any help by Suntrust to resolve this issue. To help on the mortgage side, XXXX did a loan modification for us and took our 1st mortgage from XXXX to XXXX which is a completely reasonable thing to do. Suntrust is trying to foreclose on the property rather than help us, by jacking up the rate over XXXX which took our total mortgage payment from XXXX a month to XXXX a month! Then they tried to get in first position instead of in the HELOC position by tacking on junk fees and late fees so that our second mortgage is owes more than our first mortgage, which would put them in place to be fully paid in the event of foreclosure. DIRTY POOL. I submitted a loan modification to them over 6 months ago, yes, 6 months. And they keep giving me the run around. Well, you are only 2 months behind so we can't help you. You need to be 3 months behind, but no more than 120 days behind. Oh, sorry now you are 121 days late, so now we can't help you again unless you pay another month to be 3 months behind, but not 4 months behind. Absolutely and positively ridiculous game they play.

I received an email on XX/XX/2019 stating that I would receive a temporary credit while the claim was being looked into. On XX/XX/2019 I received an email from a fraud investigator asking to contact them by phone. After trying to reach them multiple times I spoke to a representative in the fraud department only to find out the claim was still under review. I offered to give them my XXXX statements showing that no debit/payment could be found, I was never given any information on how to proceed and waited to get information on how to proceed. XX/XX/2019 I was emailed stating that my claim was denied and that the temporary credit would be reversed on XX/XX/2019. I immediately requested documents on why it was denied so that I could proceed with the rebuttal but was given little information. On XX/XX/2019 I went to my local branch to get more information on why my claim had been denied. The associate said that XXXX claimed I had authorized the charge. I filled out my rebuttal form and faxed it from the local branch. I felt that Suntrust could not give the proper documentation on why my claim was denied and how to get this resolved. On XXXX XXXX I called XXXX to see if it could be resolved on their end but was told by the representative that they have no record of Suntrust contacting them regarding my claim.

They gave me a card with their routing number and my account number. When I got home, I went online to set up my Bill Pays. I set up 5 and they were all successful and paid. I also ordered checks online for {$23.00} or so. On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX I tried to logon to my account and it said, access denied. I called Customer Service and was told that my account had been closed. I asked, why and I was told it was because of Rules and Regulations. I asked what that meant, but no one could tell me. I called XXXX, Assistant Vice President at the XXXX Branch and told her what was happening. She said there was nothing she could do. She did not know why they closed my Checking Account. During the following days I continued to contact Customer Service to see if they could tell me anything. Somewhere during my phone calls, I was transferred to the Fraud Department and spoke with a representative and once again told my account was closed due to Rules and Regulations on page 23 which says they can close my account. I asked to speak to a supervisor and then spoke with XXXX. She too gave me the same answer. She said I would receive a letter within 10 days advising of the closure. I asked her if the letter would give me the reason ; she said no. I asked her when I would get my money back from the account. She said around 20-25 days. After hours of talking with many representatives of SunTrust, I was getting nowhere. I explained to them that if fraud was involved, I needed to know asap since I had my identity stolen in XX/XX/XXXX, have been affected by the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Data Breach and I needed to straighten out the information. I finally called the Account Security and Claims at SunTrust on XX/XX/XXXX and they gave my information to the investigators and gave me a Case # ( XXXX ). The investigator was to call me that afternoon or this morning, XX/XX/XXXX. I have heard from no oneonce again. In the meantime, I have received my debit card, emails with promotions as if Im still a customer.

Their letter further stated, \" a credit bureau report was not used in making the determination ''. I was quite surprise by their decline as I have not filed a bankruptcy, or caused any lender a loss. Therefore, I ran credit on myself from the three credit reporting bureaus and all reported a Barclay Bank Delaware credit card as \" Paid, closed / Never late '' ; so how could I have caused a \" negative experience '' for them. So their internal records do not reconcile to their reporting to the credit bureaus. On XX/XX/2019 I responded to Barclay with a letter requesting clarification and a copy of the pertinent page from my XXXX report. It has been over 30 days and I have yet to hear back from Barclay.

Second time was opening a bank account with Wells just to help my bank friend to hit aggressive goal few years ago ( before it was getting to the news and being fined because of the fake-account scandal ) - again, bad experience. And this time, try again with Wells Fargo credit card last year. Called Wells Fargo today to get a replacement credit card, was told my credit card account was closed for no reason by Wells Fargo. All credit card reward associated with the credit card account are gone as well and the rep told me there is no way to retrieve without reopening the same credit card account. When I open the card, it did not state that the bank will close your card anytime without giving you a chance to redeem your point! Wells Fargo Internet banking is really outdated and it is super hard to rest the password without having the actual card - unable to reset password via email or text message associated with my Wells Fargo profile in XXXX.

      "VALUE OF S is Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..\n",

This vehicle was first insured, by me, with XX/XX/XXXXand later with XXXX XXXX. There were various times that I fell behind in my payments. In XX/XX/XXXX ( I am unsure of the date ), I spoke with a representative ( name unknown ) of Wells Fargo Dealer Services regarding my late payments. He inquired with me about my insurance, which I did have coverage, at that time with XXXX XXXX. He stated that since I was late on my payments, he was certain I didnt have insurance and stated they were going to insure the vehicle through an in-house insurance policy. I informed him that wasnt necessary and could send them my insurance policy if needed. He didnt request that I send the information. Due to falling behind in the payments, the amounts due monthly increased, but I didnt calculate the amounts for fraudulent billing practices. InXX/XX/XXXX, the truck was repossessed by Wells Fargo Dealer Services. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a Notice of Sale of Repossessed Property and Explanation of the Calculation of Surplus or Deficiency datedXX/XX/XXXX. There is a credit listed for insurance in the amount of {$710.00}, which leads me to strongly believe I was charged the CPI insurance and/or GAP insurance I had verbally declined in the previous phone conversation. Within the last two weeks, I learned that Wells Fargo Dealer Services had been in the habit of charging for CPI and/or GAP insurance without consent. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo Auto CPI Payment Program at XXXX. I spoke with an unknown female representative that refused to tell me about the Wells Fargo Auto CPI Payment Program. She took my name and stated to me that she ran my name through her system and no information returned. She inquired about any letters I have received, which I have not received any correspondence from Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. I tried to explain to her that I have relocated to another state and wanted to speak to her about the insurance charge/credit listed on the Notice I had received in XX/XX/XXXX, but she made it clear that there was nothing she was willing to discuss with me. I would like to know why I had been charged for insurance, as listed on the Notice, and exactly how much I had been charged for this unneeded expense.\n",

I was then transferred to guy who said since I was in the military that he was going to give me some Military friendly loan places but he needed my card information first.

      "VALUE OF S is This complaint is in response to the complaint number XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, we sent an offer and HUD to SPS for a short sale review. SPS indicated the offer was too low, and sent us the appraisal which is for XXXX XXXX. We received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX confirming the offer submitted was too low and we had a right to appeal. This property has been on the market over 400 days. If a higher offer could have been obtained, it would have happened. However, the buyer not only has to contend with the inferior condition of the property, but also MULTIPLE secondary liens, including a department of justice lien, and an execution that must be negotiated along with an order of conditions on the property. In the XX/XX/XXXX letter, acknowledging an offer from XX/XX/XXXXwas too low, it stated if we disagreed with the decision we had 30 days to appeal in writing. On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX we sent three separate individual value information packets for dispute, each with their own cover letter identifying appeal information. The appeals included the buyers inspection report, our listing history information, sold comps, and much more. The following week XXXX XXXX called in and confirmed receipt of this package and we were told the information was in review. At the time we submitted the XX/XX/XXXX dispute packet, a complaint to the CFPB was initiated, outlining the flaws with the appraisal that was done in XX/XX/XXXX. With the CFPB complaint we included all of the value packets, which included comps, meaning SPS didnt review the attachments. XXXX called in again and confirmed the value information was in review. On XX/XX/XXXX, We received a response back from SPS via the CFPB. In this letter, they indicated an offer they received in XX/XX/XXXX was not high enough. They did not acknowledge the current offer sent to them in XX/XX/XXXX at all. They also further said they could not analyze the information we sent because it did not include comparables, however the XX/XX/XXXX information sent in DID include comparables. XXXX XXXX called in once again and spoke to the Ombudsmans office. She was told that because we didnt submit the comps necessary for a value dispute by XX/XX/XXXX, that the comps we did submit were not considered. Im not sure HOW we could submit value dispute comps on an offer we submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. Typically a servicer reviews all the paperwork and offer and lets you know what is missing or what else is needed. That did not happen. The moment we found out the offer was too low we submitted the necessary information to dispute it. In the XX/XX/XXXX letter it stated if we wanted to appeal we had to do it in 30 days which we did on XX/XX/XXXX -XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX called in once we received the XX/XX/XXXX letter via the CFPB. On XX/XX/XXXX she spoke to the Ombudsmans office again, who at that time said they needed 3 SOLD comps within 1 mile of the subject property and dated within the last 6 months. On XX/XX/XXXX we sent them 3 comps. The were outside of the 1 mile area because even their own appraiser used comps almost 2 miles away from subject property, which is what we had to do, and we sent comps dated within 6 months of the original appraisal. We are now waiting for a decision. None of the above is proper servicing. We still have had no acknowledgement of the current buyers ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) offer. It is absolutely faulty servicing that an offer from XX/XX/XXXX still has not been acknowledged or responded too. They have also sat on value information for three weeks and have not responded, however managed to reset an auction date for XX/XX/XXXX while a file has been in review since XX/XX/XXXX.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I called a couple of years ago to close the credit card account because I had not used it for quite some time. Citibank failed to close the account and continued to charge me annual fee. They were going directly to my bank to withdraw the annual fee, {$25.00} at a time, without my direct authorization. I had not noticed the charges to my bank account in previous years after calling to have the credit card closed. This past year while undergoing a statement review ( because I changed my primary bank ) I noticed the charges in my XXXX XXXX bank account. I looked at copies of the {$25.00} checks from me to Citibank that did not have my signature. I reported it to XXXX XXXX as fraud and asked them to close that account. Then I called Citibank only to find out this was the account I had called to close a couple of years ago. They said they had no record of the cancellation. I told them they needed to cancel it immediately. They claim they have, but that I still needed to pay the {$98.00} fee because I called to late to canceled the account ( the annual fee posted in XXXX and it was now XXXX ). This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard! I asked for copies of the charges I have made in the last 36 months so they can show evidence of account activity. The people I was allowed to speak to did not have the means to produce that information, nor will they because the account has not been used - hence the reason for closing it. They simply reassertion thar the account was now closed and I was responsible to pay the {$98.00} annual fee. Citi continues to claim the debt and is now charging me late fees for not paying the annual fee for the card ( no purchases mind you ) and reporting me to the credit bureaus for delinquency. This is a rip-off of the highest degree - almost as sleazy as XXXX XXXX shenanigans a few years ago. I would like your help to stand up for principle. I have the means to pay the stupid {$98.00}, but this kind of abuse by these big banks needs to stop. They should not be allowed to operate above decent and fair business practices. When I used the card years ago to book a trip, I paid my entire bill to them on time. They are asking for money they dont deserve for a service I turned down long ago.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the XXXX, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..\n",

      "VALUE OF S is We are long-time members of USAA with multiple banking and credit accounts with this bank. We were recently victims of a financial scam involving our USAA accounts which we believe was the direct result of negligence by a USAA representative whom we contacted with concerns about a suspicious check. As a result, {$2300.00} was stolen from our accounts. Below we share the sequence of events that occurred : XX/XX/2019 : We posted our used car for sale on XXXX, with an asking price of {$5500.00}. XX/XX/2019 : We received a certified check for {$7800.00} from a buyer with an explanation that the overpayment of {$2300.00} was intended to cover the cost of shipping the car. XX/XX/2019 : We were skeptical about the check. Because we do not live near the sole USAA financial services center in XXXX XXXX, TX, we called USAA customer service to seek input and guidance. We explained the situation to the USAA front line representative outlining our concerns about the legitimacy of the check. After using the mobile deposit feature on the USAA app, the representative informed us that the funds were credited to our account and were available for immediate use. At no point during our telephone call with USAA despite our voiced suspicions about the checks legitimacy and despite sharing details about the context and provenience of the check did the bank representative inform us that the bank could not confirm the legitimacy of the check without further processing. To the contrary, the involvement of and feedback from USAAs front line representative gave us confidence that this was a legitimate check that the funds had already been credited to our account and that we could proceed with arranging to ship the car for the buyer. XX/XX/2019 : The buyer asked us to transfer money to the car mover and even suggested that we should use USAAs in-app instant transfer feature called XXXX. Our conversation with the USAA front line representative had given us the confidence to move forward with this part of the transaction even though we had never used XXXX. We adhered to the {$1000.00} daily limit for USAAs XXXX feature and transferred {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$390.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. We believed we had done our due diligence by asking the bank about the legitimacy of the certified check that the buyer had provided, we didnt feel entitled to keep more than {$5500.00} for the car, and so we were not concerned about transferring the {$2300.00} overpayment that we had received to the car mover. XX/XX/2019 : As we continued to communicate with the buyer to arrange the date/time to meet the car mover, we were informed that the original certified check whose legitimacy we had discussed with the USAA front line representative bounced. We immediately requested that a fraud claim be opened and we cooperated fully with USAAs investigation. We were told that we would receive a phone call from the bank within 7 days regarding findings from their investigation but instead received a simple email stating that no error had occurred with the XXXX transfers - which was never our contestation. We have since made repeated attempts to encourage USAA to undertake a more thorough investigation into this crime. We were victimized by a thief posing as a car buyer who capitalized on the negligence of USAAs front line representative. We sought guidance from our bank when we needed it most and the feedback we received from USAA is what gave us the confidence to move forward with the fraudulent transaction. As a result of our repeated inquiries to USAA customer service about the status of our complaint, we received a call from the Office of the CEO at USAA on Tuesday XX/XX/2019 ( first name XXXX, last name not given ). She informed us of USAAs findings following their thorough investigation : 1. The Office of the CEO determined that a crime was committed. 2. The Office of the CEO recommended coaching for the front line representative who spoke to us about the questionable certified check on XX/XX/2019 ( based on a review of our recorded call ). 3. The Office of the CEO recommended rolling out a new process to all front line analysts which addresses a process gap that they identified as a result of their investigation into our case. We believe that these findings indicate that USAA recognizes that both individual employee behavior as well as broad business practices played a role in allowing a criminal to steal {$2300.00} from us. And yet USAA refuses to reimburse us for the money that was stolen from us because we voluntarily participated in the crime. When we called USAA on XX/XX/2019, all we needed was for the USAA front line representative to tell us that it was not possible to verify the legitimacy of the certified check that we received. That statement alone likely would have spared us. Instead, the USAA front line representative told us the funds were already in our account a statement which gave us the confidence to move forward. We have come to learn that what happened to us is sadly not uncommon. But what is shocking is how the bank led us to this lions den. Front line bank representatives represent the consumers best line of defense and through this experience we have found the USAA representatives to be woefully lacking in industry knowledge. If there is a delay between the time when a check is deposited and when the legitimacy of the funds can be assured, then that should be expressed by the bank representatives especially when a customer contacts the bank expressly to verify the legitimacy of a check. Additionally, banks are now marketing XXXX as a safe and easy way to send funds. In reality, these instant transfer apps provide a convenient way for criminals to perpetrate serious, untraceable financial crimes and banks are likely profiting while exposing their customers to these unacceptable risks. We chose to become USAA members, believing USAA would act in our best interest. We are not giving up on this and we expect USAA to reimburse us for the {$2300.00} that was stolen from our account with the assistance of and under the watchful eyes of this large financial institution. Thank you for looking into this matter.\n",

My accounts with XXXX XXXX typically have balances totaling $ XXXX each month and they are always paid in full ; the balance in the XXXX XXXX account that is reported delinquent was a little more than {$200.00}, an amount that is trivial. When I learned what happened, I paid XXXX XXXX in full but was so annoyed with the way this was handled, I closed the account! Because I made a concerted effort to correct my bank information and pay XXXX XXXX in full in a timely manner, reporting the account delinquent to the credit bureaus is completely misleading -- it is the only late account on my entire credit report, that has a 36-year history. I have called XXXX XXXX on at least two occasions and asked them to remedy this but they have not. My credit score dropped approximately XXXX points because of this issue.

After I returned the money, my checking account reflected the normal amount before the check had been deposited. Thursday the XXXX I went to buy food and my debit card was declined. I called the bank and was notified that the check I deposited was reported stolen and that the funds would be replaced. On Friday XX/XX/XXXX, my direct deposit from work came in and my account was still negative. I called Citibank and they notified me that I would be responsible for the fraudulent funds I transferred out and that they are not responsible for any checks deposited. I argued that I did not know that the check was fraudulent and that the funds cleared in my account. Furthermore, I would not have authorized the transfers through XXXX/XXXX had I known that the funds were fraudulent. I spoke to several supervisors and they all told me that because I authorized the transfers from my account that I was solely responsible for the fraud and that they would not be able to credit my account for the stolen funds. They said that the check was cleared at first in good faith, and only after the return transfers were made was when the check was flagged as stolen. I am left to assume the risk and liability of the entire thing. I filed a police report and also contacted the federal trade commission.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I have been trying to get answers, explanations and resolution on my extremely TRID defiant home loan since I closed on XX/XX/2016. I did previously submit a complaint and XXXX XXXX, attorney for Chemical Bank responded to me via email, that although he knows NOTHING about TRID, RESPA/TILA or their rules that regulate mortgages, he believes the bank has done nothing wrong. I ca n't find anything right about my loan. There is nothing consistent about anything on either the LE or CD, along with their choosing to ignore forms they had me sign, from a Construction Loan Agreement for the construction rider, to an Affidavit of Occupancy which forced me to live in my home without basic items such as toilets, lights, sinks, faucets, cabinets, counters or a safe electrical system due to their refusal to disburse funds from my construction rider and although the XXXX claims to have dispersed the funds to them. Why would a buyer have to sign one to occupy in 60 days if this was a construction loan from the ground up??? Chemical Bank 's emails to me clearly indicate that they will do nothing to right this extremely WRONG situation without outside assistance. I have shown my closing docs to several title companies, lenders and Realtors with decades of experience who 've all said they 've never seen anything like it. Although the LE says I was to bring no money to close, the CD said I had to bring almost {$28000.00}. There is major inconsistency in the interest rates, purchase price, estimated payment vs bank statements, I received the CD the afternoon prior to closing at XXXX the next day. None of the docs show my XXXX % downpayment although the docs clearly state mine to be a conventional loan. I could keep going but am hoping and praying that the CFBP steps in for me just seeing what I 've attached and/or talking with Chemical Bank to personally hear that they are not willing to do anything to correct this. I 've asked them to cancel the \" construction portion '' of my loan, which I showed them TRID allows me to do since they have not given me even a penny from it. They refused. I asked if they would convert the \" construction loan '' to a \" home equity loan '' because the \" construction '' is basically complete, thus a \" construction loan no longer needed. Again, I was denied. And again, I see the only way for Chemical Bank to comply to TRID regulations and my loan made to be even sane, is to have the CFBP step in. Thanks in advance for any and all help you can give.\n",

This fraudulent withdrawal happened in XXXX, California. I was working that time in XXXX XXXX, California. I have never lost my wallet/debit card and the transaction stated it was Teller Cash Withdrawal. If someone is withdrawing this large amount of cash, shouldn't the teller have to check the ID?

'' After waiting more than 60 business days, they just send me a PDF with that simple explanation. What did they do to help their loyal customer? This is an outrageous result.

      "VALUE OF S is 1. On XX/XX/2019, I approached the Suntrust branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Georgia XXXX, with a check to deposit. 2. The check is in the amount of XX/XX/XXXX dollars and is made out to the nonprofit organization where I am XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 3. We need immediate access to the funds, or at least to have no hold placed on the account. 4. The check was drawn on an account at XXXX XXXX XXXX that, if Suntrust had made any effort to confirm or certify funds, would have shown that the funds were available. 5. I asked the teller, XXXX, if she could call XXXX XXXX to confirm funds. She stated I would have to walk over to XXXX XXXX myself to confirm funds. I stated that this obviously would not assist with my funds being made available by Suntrust. After all, I didn't need to confirm funds myself, I am confident in the funds. 6. The teller next to her, XXXX, also became involved in the conversation. Neither seemed familiar with the process of what I was asking them to do. I had to explain that other banks in the past have been able to pick up a phone and confirm funds in order to make them available. They said they could not do that, that they could only deposit the check and they would not even be able to tell me whether there would be a hold. 7. Under duress, I deposited the check at the branch. The receipt did not state anything about a hold. I asked the tellers, and they said they had no information about any hold. This prevented me from undoing the deposit even if I wanted to ; I could have explored check cashing options or other options with the check but Suntrust withholds information from its customers that would allow them to make a good decision regarding what to do with their check. 8. I called Suntrust Customer Service, spoke with XXXX. 9. XXXX stated that the branch, in fact, at their discretion, could have attempted to contact XXXX XXXX, but apparently failed to even offer to do. XXXX stated that, if Suntrust was able to confirm the funds by phone, the branch would pass this information on to the \" back office, '' that would then be able to not place a hold based on the information. ( Suntrust branch never did this. ) 10. XXXX also stated that as part of the back office processing that they would attempt to confirm the funds themselves, either electronically or by calling XXXX XXXX. ( Clearly, the back office never did this either due to either laziness or a desire to victimize me and my nonprofit. ) 11. I called the XXXX branch and left a message for the manager and Vice President, XXXX. 12. XXXX called me back in the late afternoon. He stated that calling XXXX XXXX would not do any good because they would refuse to provide the information, and he said that even with confirmation from XXXX XXXX and the writer of the check, that Suntrust would likely not release the hold. XXXX insisted that all banks had the same policies regarding this. ( which I do not believe is correct ). 13. Suntrust itself offers a merchant verification option for merchants who receive a check drawn upon Suntrust. When calling the customer service line ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and saying the words \" merchant verification , '' Suntrust offers an option for the merchant to enter the account number and other information related to the check into the phone system to verify funds. If Suntrust offers this, it is unclear why they insist that no other bank does. 14. The Funds Availability Policy Disclosure for Deposit Accounts ( \" Disclosure document '' ) states on page seven : \" We will notify you if we are going to delay the availability of the deposited items and tell you when the funds will be available. '' However, Suntrust is not following its own policies. The tellers did not notify me even when I asked them ; customer service did not notify me even when I asked them ; and the branch manager did not notify on XX/XX/XXXX, even when I asked him. Then, on today, XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX XXXX XXXX only shows an amount of the hold, not the date that the hold will be released. I had to actually call the manager, XXXX, to find out the dates. See : https : //URL 15. The Disclosure document also states on p. 7, \" If we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you a notice of hold no later than the first business day after we receive your deposit. '' This implies that they are supposed to tell you *before* you leave the premises in normal circumstances, which they did not do. There is no evidence that a letter has been sent to me. 16. The Disclosure document also states on p. 7, \" If you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available. '' I do need the funds right away ; I did ask ; and no information was provided. Why is Suntrust encouraging its customers to ask questions to which no answers are ever available at the time of deposit, and where Suntrust has no interest or willingness in verifying funds to assist the customer? I recommend the following revision : \" If you will need funds from a deposit right away, go to XXXX and realize that Suntrust does not care. '' 17. On this morning, the XXXX XXXX XXXX showed a hold in the amount of {$34000.00}, but did not state when the hold would be removed. 18. I called the branch and XXXX revealed that XXXX dollars is to be available tomorrow ; {$4400.00} will be available on the XX/XX/XXXX ; and {$30000.00} will be available on XX/XX/XXXX. 19. These dates do not bear any relationship to when Suntrust is to receive confirmation of funds clearing from the check. That is, there is no way it takes more than a week for funds to clear. Upon information and belief, Suntrust is intending to hold at least {$30000.00} of funds without any justification. 20. Suntrust agents have contradicted each other on numerous occasions throughout this process. 21. First, XXXX stated that the branch could call XXXX XXXX, but the branch, both tellers and manager, have refused to do so. 22. Second, XXXX stated that the back office would confirm funds as part of nightly processing. However, the back office has clearly have not done so, because if they had, they would realize that these are good funds that should be made immediately available. 23. Third, Suntrust is not following the promises it makes to customers in its Disclosure Document regarding customers being able to receive information regarding holds when the deposit is made ; and it is encouraging customers who need funds to ask questions about their funds that Suntrust refuses to answer and to which Suntrust is completely unwilling to assist. The Disclosure should make all of that clear - that holds are a big mystery, that there is no reason to ask questions, that Suntrust doesn't care whether the funds are valid and confirmable, that Suntrust will hold funds longer than necessary in order to victimize customers and profit off of them. 24. All of this is harming me, my nonprofit, and the people we serve. 25. Once these funds clear, I am closing this account.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I have sufficient evidence the debt in question is not in default, and has been in repayment based on the agreed upon terms of {$200.00} per month since XXXX with the Department of Defense. Furthermore, the amount that is stated as owed is incorrect and should be corrected to reflect the actual balance due. My records indicate the amount outstanding after the four subsequent wage garnishments is {$9600.00}. While in administrative review, I expect the amount in question to be held constant and only be netted down in the even a wage garnishment is applied. The exhibit below shows the payments made since XX/XX/XXXX, showing consistent and continual payments. Secondarily, I object to the administrative fee that was applied to the note of approximately {$5000.00}, which represents approximately $ 41 % of the total outstanding loan balance. This practice and act was not approved and I gave no prior consent to adding this fee, it is also applied in error as this should have never been moved over in the first place to the US Treasury and should have been kept and housed within the DOD repayment website. This fee amount represents predatory lending practices and is a fee that is unconscionable, especially since the 10yr US Treasury Yield is 2.668 % as of XX/XX/XXXX. The mere size and existence of this fee is unacceptable ; in other terms it represents 2 years of hard work and labor paying down the note. As of XX/XX/XXXX - Four wage garnishments have been extracted from my pay in the last 36 days equating to {$3700.00} challenging my ability to pay my normal monthly bills and living expenses to support my wife and child.

      "VALUE OF S is Notice to whom it be of concern,It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \"would be plaintiffs\", yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance (such as perfect metro 2 format reporting) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates ,balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses , the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued (particularly for collection) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim(s) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA,HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA,FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.1) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff(s) {should I forward into a civil complaint} or with the entity(ies) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit(s) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging (or even unknowingly doing so) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers (or to-be plaintiff) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim(s) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.4) I have no knowledge of ever entering into a open account with to-be Plaintiff(s) or with the entity(ies) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit(s) or derogatory claims of credit.5) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt(s), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim(s) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge(s) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is In XXXX of XXXX I was contacted by Synchrony Bank regarding the past due balance on my Care Credit card. At that time they gave me the option to make 6 prearranged, direct debit payments toward my balance in an effort to get the balance current and pay down the amount owed. I agreed to the arrangement and the payment amounts that were quoted to me. Subsequently, I have made all of the payments, on time, yet my balance has continued to go up and is now higher than it was when I began the payments. I contacted Synchrony bank on XX/XX/XXXX to try and understand why this was occurring and was told that if the payments made were not full payments, I would be charged late fees which amounted to more than half of the arranged payments. I stated that they dictated the payment amounts of the payment arrangement and all were made on time so I did not feel that late fees should have been charged. They then told me that they would file a complaint regarding the fees and would contact me further regarding the outcome. I was never contacted. I just received another statement from Care Credit and my balance has once again grown. I called again and was told again that even though I paid my arrangements on time, as they were not full payments (? ), late fees would apply. My initial credit limit on this card was XXXX which I used for critical dental work. I have made sincere attempts to pay off the account.

That all dates are reporting correctly and that any prior pay history you are reporting is correct Please remove this account from my credit report immediately! It has caused quite bit of damage. I want to point out that you are legally liable for any erroneous information as decided in XXXX vs. XXXX XXXX. This case set a legal precedent that a consumer can sue you for reporting inaccurate information on their credit report. I demand that you remove this account immediately. Should this account not be taken care of, my next step will be to file complaints with the FTC, XXXX, State Attorney General, and any other place I can think to file a complaint.

As I absolutely have not authorized anyone at XXXX to review my credit file, please ensure XXXX and Experian remove this offending inquiry from my credit file/report as it is damaging my credit rating and hindering my ability to establish credit. I have attempted to resolve this matter directly with XXXX and Experian to no avail. Therefore, I am contacting you, as the designated federal agency to assist consumers/victims of such Violations, to investigate and finally resolve the matter so that my credit file/report is accurate. I thank you for your sincere consideration of this matter, and look forward to a prompt and amicable resolution of this matter. Kindest regards, XXXX XXXX\n",

      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/2019, I contacted National Recovery Agency in reference to the debt verification letter that was not received in a timely manner after it was requested. They stated that they had the wrong address and they were correcting it and resending it. I emailed them telling them I consider this verification untimely because it may not arrive in time to dispute the alleged debt, which the original creditor says was an error in their records and that I do not owe. NRA Group , LLC stated that they would continue to collect the debt. When asked for proof they were liscenced to collect denlbts in Illinois and the state of South Carolina ( or on a Military Installation, for that matter ) they refused to provide liscenced number and proof as a registered debt collection agency. XXXX XXXX said the debt should not have been reported to collections.

I finally now get emails that a bill is late ( never before that ... hmmm ) and the links in the email to go and pay the bill NEVER work. They literally are all broken links with no way to pay. In addition, I set up autopay. But each time it doesn't auto charge me, they say it will skip a month, and then they don't remind you and they want you to set up autopay AGAIN. And the cycle continues. I am not planning to use the card anymore despite the 5 % cashback offered on XXXX purchases. I would like to have all of my late fees refunded to me. Honestly, I have never had a credit card that the issuer makes so hard to pay. I got one email while travelling and did not have all the info I needed ... then it gets later ... it literally takes a few days to figure out how to log in and pay each month. Meanwhile, they rack up late fees. RUN AWAY!!!\n",

      "VALUE OF S is XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/Tek-Collect Inc Date : XX/XX/XXXX Re : Acct # XXXX To Whom It May Concern : I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX Vs. XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at 13. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s. You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. I intend to follow through with the suit if I do not hear back from you within 15 days. I look forward to hearing from you, Thank you.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is This report is to highlight my view of Experian and their interaction with people whose information they collect. Background : My personal birthdate information was displayed incorrectly on my information on the Experian web site. They have a dispute link to report incorrect information. I used this link and reported the issue, and provided an approved government issued document to provide the correct information. Problem : Experian sent me an email ( XXXX ) dated XXXX XX/XX/2019, XXXX XXXX. This email stated Hi ( my name ), your dispute results are ready, your disport report number ( number withheld for this complaint ) results are ready for review. And then they have a link to click to view results. I opened the link to review results, and the results had not been corrected. Problem Two : After some amount of difficulty, I was able to speak to a live dispute representative, and explained the entire scenario to them, including the dispute report number, the fact that I had received an email informing me that the result of the dispute are ready for me to review, and that the dispute had not in fact been corrected. The representative explained to me that the results would not be updated for approximately 30 days due to the type of Experian membership I have. I asked her, why Experian sent me an email stating the dispute results are ready for my review if the report has not been updated for my review. Basically at that point, the dispute representative hung up the phone without further explanation. My general view of this interaction : Experian does not value nor respect the people whose data they collect. I believe to Experian, my information is nothing more than a data point that they use and sell to other financial institutions. I do not have the ability to take my business to another credit bureau, there are no commercial consequences to Experian for their misbehaver in their treatment of the data points they collect. Experian lost control of my personal data some years ago, and since then, I have experienced several attempted identity fraud events which I have reported to local law enforcement. Experians solution to this was a one year free credit monitoring service, but I can for a fee of {$19.00} per month contract with Experian to provide additional identify coverage to resolve a problem that they created. It reminds me of the protection racket run by criminals, they would damage or rob your store and then later they would approach the business owner and offer protection from future damage or robberies from occurring for a monthly fee.\n",

Finally I got a lawyer to try and settle this debt, and they have sent a letter requesting an amount to pay, this amount includes interest, as well as a statement saying I would be charged annual interest at 6 %. I had never agreed to pay any interest to the apartment complex or IQ data systems. However the amount reflected on my credit report is much higher than the amount the apartment complex has said that I owe them. The IQ Data Intonational has apparently decided upon themselves to charge me interest as well as put this on my credit report, which is showing I owe around XXXX dollars which is well over the amount the apartment complex says that I owe as well above any amount this IQ data international company would be able to prove i owe with any debt validation letter or statement. They have just decided they can charge whatever they want without any legal basis. ( see attached files for the \" debt validation '' as well as a statement from them ADMITTING they are charging me interest on a debt that's not legal for. also notice on my credit report they have reported an amount higher than the debt validation document that I have attached which is clearly an illegal practice by them ) Also I had disputed this debt with the credit agencies some time ago, and never received any documentation at that time or for months afterwards validating this debt, yet they have not removed the debt and have continued to call me to collect the debt. Also when they have called they have been quite rude and sarcastic. It is my complaint that they are breaking the law by placing on my credit report, as well as asking me to pay an about well over what they are entitled to, I have a letter from them saying they will charge me interest, which is not legal, and they have no legal basis to do this, yet they have done it. As well they have put on my credit report an amount well over the amount owed, which I can only assume is also some sort of interest penalty which is again not legal, was never agreed to and is a blatant disregard for state and federal laws which show this does not apply to an apartment complex contract.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Several months ago I contacted XXXX XXXX on an old credit card bill that was charged off so I could help increase my credit score. The amount was under {$1500.00}. It was agreed verbally that the payoff would be decreased to {$700.00}. I was able to pay {$500.00} that day and agreed to pay the remaining {$200.00} when I could over the next several months. They agreed on a recorded line and also sent me a settlement letter. Since that time, I can not find a copy of the settlement letter they sent me as it was in my briefcase stolen from my fiance 's truck when there were break ins in our neighborhood in XXXX County ( they also stole his laptop and we have proof of all this/the thieves were apprehended ). That being said, this past week I have been receiving letters from several lawyers that a class action suit has been filed against me by XXXX XXXX - at least 5 letters came. I called XXXX XXXX 's customer service number but it only asks me to please hold and then a law firm picks up. I explained to them that I had reached a settlement agreement with XXXX XXXX but they refused to listen, stating I owed over {$1400.00} and needed to produce the settlement letter to prove this. I told them I needed to speak to XXXX XXXX because the call was recorded and I did not have a copy of the letter, and asked if there was another number I could call. The first staffer I spoke to stated I needed to speak to XXXX XXXX directly but I told them I keep getting transfered over. He couldn't help me. The second staffer I spoke to stated the same - you owe {$1400.00} and at that point I got very upset and stated I was not hanging up until they put me in touch with XXXX XXXX or gave me a number to call them - so she hung up on me. I feel this is fraud and they are trying to collect money that is not owed. I payed the {$500.00} and only owe {$200.00} but how can I prove this if I can't get through to XXXX XXXX? This law firm is blocking me from getting through to XXXX XXXX to get the legitimate information which is my right. They are demanding money that is not owed and this is in no way fair\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Experian should be closed down. I am at the end of my rope with them. I had some fraud through my bank and they recommended a freeze or fraud alert on my credit bureaus. I did this. In XX/XX/XXXX I was trying to trade my truck in for less expensive vehicle. Two different dealerships tried to help me get through to experian. The only options are to record fraud or order credit report. We tried for two months. I finally sent a written request along with copy of my drivers license. Instead of someone calling to help I received a letter in mail about a month later telling me to send another request in writing and also include a copy of a bill.

When I called to activate card I was told it had been cancelled by experian because it was reported as stolen and fraud. I was so furious. Not only did my credit get hit to open the account now it has a closed account. Closed against my wishes. Not one time did anyone contact me and ask if I opened this card. I am having trouble getting the card reissued. The only phone number anyone has for experian is XXXX. This number does nothing to help. I not only lost chance to trade in my vehicle for a more economical one, I had my card cancelled and am flagged with the creditor as fraudulent opening of credit card.

      "VALUE OF S is Nationstar Mortgage ( Subservicer for XXXX ) has inaccurately managed/inaccurately funded my escrow account two years in a row, resulting in escrow shortages over {$2000.00} that I've been responsible for paying back because of their mistakes. When I bought my home on XX/XX/XXXX, Nationstar setup my escrow account to pay taxes bi-annually. This is not allowed in the city I live in, they only accept tax payments paid annually or quarterly. This caused an escrow shortage of {$2400.00}. In the \" XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ( attached ), it states the home sellers credited me {$2400.00} to cover the taxes from XX/XX/XXXX to when I bought the house on XX/XX/XXXX. That {$2400.00} was never applied to the escrow account. Instead, Nationstar credited it towards closing costs. XXXX and I called XXXX ( our facilitator at closing ) at XXXX XXXX and she informed us that the lender is responsible for collecting the appropriate amount to escrow, not the title company. XXXX said that it was not closing company 's responsibility to ensure that the {$2400.00} went towards the escrow account. XXXX suggested that I instead contact my loan officer ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) regarding the issue. XXXX XXXX was ultimately unable to resolve or help with the issue at all, claiming that once an interest rate is locked in, the rest of the mortgage process is completely out of his hands. I've since confirmed that the tax documentation from the title company that was sent to the loan processors in charge of my account conveyed that the taxes should have been paid annually. Yet, NationStar setup my taxes to be paid bi-annually, thus creating this - {$2400.00} negative balance in the escrow account. I contacted the county treasurer asking if a partial refund could be made to put my escrow account in good standing so we could then re-run an escrow analysis. They informed me they do not issue refunds. After talking to every representative at Nationstar and being escalated to the point where I met the highest point of management and could not be escalated any more, I was informed they could either adjust my mortgage monthly payment by $ 250+/month to make up for the shortage, or I could keep my mortgage payment the same if I paid the - {$2400.00} in a lump sum. Defeated, I paid the - {$2400.00} lump sum and moved on. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX. I receive a check in the mail for from NationStar for {$3100.00} along with a letter stating my escrow account is in surplus. I call them and they claim that my escrow account is over-funded. I explain all the issues I had last year, and ask them to re-evaluate. They research, and retract saying they made another mistake. NationStar had my escrow account setup to pay taxes annually, but at the quarterly rate of {$840.00}. Because of this, my total taxes paid for the year of XX/XX/XXXX are only {$840.00}. They should have had my escrow account setup to pay taxes quarterly at a rate of {$840.00} ( four times a year ). Instead, they only paid once. Now, they have cancelled the {$3100.00} check, re-distributed it into my escrow account, and claimed they've set my account up to pay the appropriate quarterly taxes.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is On or around XX/XX/2021 I attempted to use my unemployment debit card, issued by Bank of America, at a Casino ATM in XXXX, NV. I have used the card at casino ATM 's in the past without any problems. Since there are no Bank of America ATM 's within 50-100 miles of where I live, I frequently use the casino ATM 's to withdraw cash. On this particular night, my debit card was declined at the casino ATM. After 3 failed attempts, I called the Bank of America card holders phone number to speak to a bank representative. I was told there was nothing wrong with my card that they could see and they recommended trying a different ATM, which I did and it still declined. After 3-4 phone calls to Bank of America, each representative telling me to try another ATM, I was finally transferred to their Fraud department, where I spoke with a very rude woman, who told me I was not supposed to use my unemployment debit card in a casino and that there was nothing wrong with my card. At this point I was frustrated from trying several different ATM 's, multiple calls to the Bank of America banking center and still no access to my unemployment benefits. The woman in the Fraud department said I could go to a nearby Bank of America branch and see if they could help me, but she could do nothing more for me. Toward the end of that call, she said, and I quote, \" What part do you not understand? There is nothing wrong with your card. '' and quickly disconnected the call. When I attempted to use the card again, it declined saying the card had been closed. I called Bank of America and was told my card had been closed due to suspected fraud. I asked what was needed from me to validate what had recently occurred by the multiple attempts at trying to withdraw money and I was told I would need to contact Unemployment because they are the ones that closed the account. I called the State of NV Unemployment office and was told I needed to contact the Bank and request a new debit card and they didn't see any issues on their end so it was the bank we needed to deal with. I have been told multiple different answers as to why my account was closed by Bank of America and with each of those answers I am told I need to contact the sponsor, Unemployment, and request they fix the issue. Each time I call Unemployment, I am told I need to contact the bank since it was their Fraud department that put the 'freeze ' on my account. Meanwhile neither party will agree to doing a 3-way conference call, with me on the line, to see who needs to do what in their system to 'unfreeze ' my account. Meanwhile, I continue to file my weekly unemployment claims and can see that payments are still being issued, not sure where they are being issued to, but my payment history reflects weekly benefits are still being paid. There was never a hold or freeze or pause put on the Unemployment benefit side and there are currently no \" Issues Delaying Payment '' showing on my UI profile homepage. I have been going through this same process for almost 8 weeks and am no further today than I was when I first started chasing my unemployment benefits. I have had no issues with receiving benefit payments since I've been on unemployment, until this happened. There was no suspected fraud. I was told to keep trying different ATM 's to access my funds. No one will pull any of the recorded calls or find someone, anyone, that is willing to go the extra mile to help me. I've been put on hold for hours, then hung up on. I've been straight hung up on. I've been told there is nothing either party can do for me and that I need to contact the other party as it is there issue. At this point, I don't know who's issue it is or how to fix it because I'm stuck in the middle and have absolutely no idea what to say anymore or where to go for help. I talked to the XXXX office and filled out an intake form for them over a month ago, but have yet to hear back from anyone.

      "VALUE OF S is This complaint is what I consider to be a 'follow up ' to a complaint I previously submitted and it is regarding the \" Price Rewind '' benefit for XXXX/Citi Visa cardholders. Basically, if I find a lower price on something that I purchased with my XXXX Visa card, Citi will refund me the difference. Of course, there are a number of exclusions but I am mainly concerned with this one : \" The lower-priced item is a going-out-of-business sale item or from an internet auction site. '' As I pointed out in my previous complaint, I would not expect Citi to honor a Price Rewind from an actual 'auction ' type transaction. In my case, I had purchased a computer monitor from XXXX, and later found the same exact monitor at XXXX XXXX XXXX store for {$70.00} cheaper. If you refer to the attached document for details you can see that XXXX sold at least 253 of these monitors at the fixed price of {$790.00}. This was not an auction. It was a simple transaction much like purchasing an item from XXXX via one of their vendors. Fixed price, full warranty, return policy, and more than one of the items. Citi actually did honor the two Price Rewinds, calling it a one-time courtesy but they basically blew me off and never addressed the root of my complaint - XXXX is not just an auction site. Afterwards, I was given the opportunity to provide additional feedback and I later received the attached letter from Ms XXXX in response. In reading the letter, I felt like she never really looked at my complaint. I had clearly covered the items in her response in my complaint, yet she chose to ignore them. This is a direct quote from her letter : \" Based on the underlying nature of XXXX, customers generally have to bid on products in order to purchase them. Because all of the prices on XXXX are not fixed, we do not accept the lower price. Thus, we consider XXXX and similar sites to be auction sites. '' It is my understanding that each \" Price Rewind '' is actually assigned to a 'claims agent '. It would be very easy for an agent to see that buying something from an XXXX store, such as XXXX, is not an auction. I believe Citi is being disingenuous in their interpretation of their 'auction site ' exclusion to avoid having to pay out on these Price Rewind claims.\n",

However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously specifies an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( C ). Duty to Correct and Update Information If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action.

He specifically said the account was verified but they dont have to tell me how they verified it or what information was used to verify it. XXXX also stated they dont keep information in consumer files about the debt. I know this is against the FCRA because all accounts must be 100 % accurate, 100 % verifiable and 100 % timely.

      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/19, I went into a Bank of America branch to make a {$300.00} cash payment on my credit card at the teller window. I was intercepted by a banker who made me do the transaction at an ATM, even though I was not comfortable depositing cash there. With the banker as a witness to the entire transaction, the ATM ate my money and spit out a receipt that said the request couldn't be processed and my items could not be returned to me. The banker escorted me to a phone, where she placed a call to the claims department and filed a claim on my behalf. At that time, I was told the bank had up to 10 days to resolve the claim. The bank then kept extending their deadline for resolution. It appears that any time someone checked the status of the claim, they closed the claim and restarted the clock on it as a new claim. After multiple visits to the branch, there was no resolution, so I tweeted at the bank on XX/XX/19. One of the bank 's social media reps called me to follow up, and I shared the entire story with her. She said she'd look into and get back to me. When she called me on XX/XX/19, she reported that the bank had investigated and my claim was being denied. She said the investigation found no overage of cash in the ATM that day, and then she claimed that the bank had security footage of me getting the money back and that the bank employee who'd helped me file the claim said I'd received the money.

      "VALUE OF S is REQUEST FOR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT!!! I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Act first established XX/XX/2003 was intended to establish a plan whereas common American citizens could obtain a copy of their credit reports at least once a year free of charge. Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary. Even though I may have received an approval of an updated credit report from either Experian, XXXX XXXX or XXXX respectively, it is unfair that I need to do a mail request since I can submit my personal information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal. I believe that since the CFPB is the sole responsible oversight party of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, its imperative that any additional solicitation of information from the credit bureaus should be blocked permanently. I along with any other citizen should receive a free credit report upon request. The credit reporting agencies are an important aspect of the national banking system to properly function, but the current aggressive marketing campaign soliciting citizens for an arbitrary FICO score has gone too far, including but not limited to Experian Boost. We must return to a common ground that is fair for all consumers in the United States, and we must be able to request additional marketing on our own terms. Accordingly, I am making a request for a free credit report with confirmation number to my attached email address. Thank you. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX SS # ENDING IN XXXX\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/XXXX, I have visited XXXX XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I expressed interest in joining the facility. The attendant at the front desk employee took my information and gave me small membership card to join. I selected the $ XXXXmonth fee package to use the facility. I was informed that this is a month to month membership and I can cancel anytime. The front desk also offered me a free training session on that day. After the free training session, the trainer offered me to purchase more training session. With the suggestion of the trainer, I agreed to purchase 4 sessions for {$130.00} on the same day XX/XX/XXXX. On the following month on XX/XX/XXXX, I saw another charge of {$130.00} in my credit card for another 4 more training sessions. In total, I have paid for 8 training sessions. While 1 paid training session remaining unused, I informed the assistant manager of the facility on XX/XX/XXXX that I will not be using the facility anymore. Even after informing the facility, their system kept billing me and kept adding training sessions that I did not ask for and never used. Surprisingly, I received numerous calls from a collection agency on the week of XX/XX/XXXX. When I spoke with the agency on XX/XX/XXXX, the agency told me I owe money XXXX XXXX. After learning about this, I contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with the club Manager XXXX XXXX. While speaking with XXXX he informed me of a contract which I was uninformed of. After several requests, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX provided me a copy of that said contract which doesnt have my signature. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have also requested copy of my usage and billing history which I did not receive. XXXX XXXX did not provide me with a copy of that said contract before XX/XX/XXXX. Without providing me a valid contract, the company kept adding charges for services that I had never asked for and I had never used. Without contacting me directly, XXXX XXXX, shared my information with a third party collection agency. The collection agency threatened to report me to credit bureaus and damage my perfect credit history. XXXX XXXX owes me a refund for the 1 session that I couldnt use due to scheduling conflict with the trainer. XXXX XXXX and its 3rd party collection agency is demanding payment for something I had never asked for and I had never used. The facts : 1 ) I had not received these contract from XXXX XXXX directly from the time time I had started using the facility and to the period I had stopped using the facility. 2 ) the signatures on the papers are not my signatures. 3 ) these charges were recurring training fees charges which I had never asked for and never used? 4 ) Neither XXXX XXXX not the collection agency provided me usage history even after multiple requests. Even before I had notified the front desk that I will no longer use the facility, I was charged for sessions for which sessions were not provided due to schedule conflict with the trainer. XXXX actually owes me money for those sessions that was not provided. 4 ) If I want take this matter to the court, which court will have jurisdictions over this matter? I think the state AGs Office regulates the fitness clubs. But in case of I demand a trial, which court should I go to? Would you represent me in this case? No one reviewed the terms and no such phone call. Also they didnt give me copy of a contract. After I received call from collection agency, I called the facility and I told them that I was not aware of any agreement. Then the club manager XXXX told me that XXXX XXXX sent me copy of contract at my email at XXXX. But my email is XXXX. So XXXX thought they gave me contract even though they were sending it to the wrong address. XXXX Calls me and emails me saying that XXXX will turn over this account to collection agency. How can XXXX do it when In fact XXXX already turned this over to collection agency before? I became aware of this balance from the collection agency.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/XXXX I opened two accounts with CitiBank as part of a promotion they had for a {$600.00} cash credit after 90 days. The terms were that I needed to fund an account with {$50000.00} and they'd open both a Checking and Savings account under their \" Priority '' package. In order to get the {$600.00} bonus I needed to keep both accounts funded with a total of {$50000.00} for 60 days and then in 90 days I'd get the promotional bonus. The savings account was funded with {$50000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called CitiBank customer service to confirm that I had done everything necessary to receive this bonus. The Citi representative confirmed that I had met the funding requirements and that I am good to receive the bonus if I do not touch the {$50000.00} in my savings account. At no time did the representative tell me that I needed to have any amount of money in my checking account with Citi. I was led to believe that as long as I had {$50000.00} between the two accounts I would be in good standing. On XX/XX/XXXX my checking account was closed by Citi due to a zero balance. I was not notified that the account was in danger of closing or that all I needed to do was transfer in {$1.00} to keep this account open. I logged into Citibank.com to check my accounts on XX/XX/XXXX and found out my checking account was closed. I immediately called Citi customer service to get the account re-opened. On my XX/XX/XXXX call with Citi I was told that my checking account was closed due to XXXX balance and that it can not be re-opened. Furthermore, they told me that I would no longer be eligible for the {$600.00} promotional bonus as I would need to have both a checking and savings account in good standing at the time the promotional payment period came up ( 90 days after meeting requirements ... approximately XX/XX/XXXX ). I escalated to another level of management and was then told that I needed to go to a Citi branch location to try to re-open my account. There is no Citi branch location anywhere near where I live so this is not possible. I called Citi back on XX/XX/XXXX because I read that they should be able to re-open closed accounts within 30 days of closing. I spoke to the first level of support and then was transferred over to the support manager. The manager tried to re-open my checking account but told me that there was a reason code that did not allow for re-opening. She also confirmed that I would not be eligible for the {$600.00} promotional bonus without having this checking account opened. I asked for another escalation and she said that she was the highest level of support that I could get. In summary, Citi has held {$50000.00} of my money which they have been earning interest on while I have earned {$13.00} in my savings account due to the small APR/APY that the account earns. They failed to notify me that I needed to fund my checking account multiple times ( first when I called in XXXX, and then when they closed my account without asking me ). They refused to re-open this account even though I requested twice within the 30 day window after closure. They have also made me ineligible to receive the {$600.00} promotion which was the only reason I opened the account. I feel like I have been defrauded and tricked by Citi.\n",

I have attached my last 54 payments and I also have the receipts for the current month as well. These receipts come directly from the court clery. I have exhausted all avenues trying to get assistance with this matter and in my research, I found that it is my right by law to have this account, completely deleted from my credit report and never to be reported again, due to the errors in the reporting of this account. This legal right is granted by the FCRA and I would like to enforce this right as I have been harmed for years now, with no assistance is correcting this matter.

      "VALUE OF S is I purchased furniture from XXXX XXXX XXXX in Florida in XX/XX/2019. XXXX offered no-interest financing ( 0.0 % APR ) for 18 months with no fees. I accepted their offer and financed the furniture based on their representation that there would be no interest or fees for 18 months. The store opened an installment credit account in my name with Synchrony Consumer Financial and charged the furniture to that account. Two months later, I noticed charges on the account for \" card security '' and monthly interest charges presumably related to the card security fees. Upon further investigation, I discovered that Synchrony and/or XXXX had, without my permission, registered me for \" debt cancellation '' insurance at a cost of 1.6 % of the monthly balance on the account. I did not request or accept the service when I purchased the furniture. The charges simply appeared on my monthly statement. The terms and conditions, which I subsequently discovered, state that all charges will be refunded if the service is cancelled within 90 days. Luckily I noticed the charges and cancelled the service with two weeks to spare, although it remains to be seen if the fees will be refunded.\n",

Instead it provides XXXX but that number does *not* lead to any person. Instead its voice prompts all redirect back to the web site or offer to sell monitoring. So exactly how can consumers clear up problems when the directions to fix are all fake? More importantly, what is CFPB doing in near real time to protect consumers in such an easy-to-police situation? Clearly Experian is not interested in cleaning up bad information, otherwise they would provide a phone number that leads to a real person. Furthermore, Experian has all kinds of phone numbers that XXXX reveals however are they really Experian or clever scams to get ss numbers from frustrated consumers trying to get through to Experian? Furthermore when calling the 'real ' Experian number on my cell which is listed in my credit score, they state they attempt to vett calls but then \" please say your ss number '' so are they vetting, or merely creating a way for fraudsters to copy this automated screening and get ss numbers? Self serving and no oversight seem to be rampant in financial service and CFPB seems deaf, or impotent, to it all.\n",

In XX/XX/XXXX I set up and initiated a monthly automated payment of {$52.00} to settle the debt. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from my credit reporting agency that there was a negative collection reported on my credit on XX/XX/XXXX and realized that the last payment made to Sunrise Credit Services was on XX/XX/XXXX. There were two remaining payments to be made which would have brought my account to a zero balance. I called Sunrise Credit Services to ascertain why payments were stopped. I was informed that XXXX \" took the account back ''. Upon further inquiry with XXXX, they reported that because the account was still outstanding, they referred the account to XXXX XXXX to collect the remaining balance of {$100.00}, despite on-time monthly payments being made. I had no knowledge nor received any notice, written letter or otherwise, that the account had been transferred. XXXX XXXX reported that phone calls were made to my home number, however, no written notice was mailed.

I asked has this information reported delinquent to the credit bureaus and the XXXX representative advised they do not report 30 days and report the first delinquency at 60 days and since today is the XXXX day if payment were received XXXX would not report the late payment. I said, are you sure? He stated yes, and I then provided my information to bring the account current. Before ending the call I asked if he could provide something in writing the account would not report and he said no, but I work for XXXX and this will not report as past due. On XX/XX/XXXX I received updates from all bureaus that XXXX reported 30 days delinquent.

Unfortunately, I suffered a XXXX and I am currently drawing a Social Security XXXX check each month. It has taken me a wile to get back to some normalcy of life and I am just getting to the point where I can submit this complaint. I had an extensive conversation with a representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX and they told me that there was no fraud on my part based on there research with Bank of America but that I was certainly a victim of a scam operation. I am unable to open a checking/savings account today because I have been flagged as having an account that had fraudulent activity on it. I was not aware of this until I recently tried to open a new account along with my wife. Please see the attached document detailing the events that occurred against me in XX/XX/XXXX. I am asking that the account listed as fraudulent be removed due to the actions of a company that was willfully and knowingly scamming me. Source of Information : Bank of America Missouri ; XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, MO XXXX Phone Number : XXXX Reported For : Suspected Fraud Activity Reported Name : Reported SSN ; RTN/Acct # : XXXX Closure Status ; Unpaid* Closure Status Date : XX/XX/XXXX Dear Sir/Madam : I am disputing the matter that my checking account with Bank of America Missouri had any fraudulent activity on it in any manner. I have a phone message that I have kept since XX/XX/XXXX from a company/individual who was portraying themselves as a loan officer representing a loan company. The actual audio transcript reads as follows : This message is for Mr. XXXX XXXX. This is officer XXXX XXXX trying to get in touch with you in regards to your loan application and the money has been successfully transferred. We are just waiting for your response that you have talked to the bank and you have to give me a call back in order to talk with you to check your balance. So give me call back as fast as you can. My number is XXXX, I repeat XXXX, Goodbye. This scammer was asking me to give them my checking account information in order to verify the funds I have in the bank as well as to confirm that my checking account was a valid account. I have spoken with the Risk Management Department of Bank of America as well as the Fraud Department of Bank of America. I was told by representatives of Bank of America that this was not fraud but it was a clear case of me being scammed. They went on to tell me that this was a common practice among fraudsters. They prey on those who are seeking a loan and gather my personal information and attempt to steal money from my account. In my case the fraudster wrote a counterfeit check to deposit into my account and then tried to immediately withdraw that money they had illegally deposited. This occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. I went to the local Bank of America office on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, FL to talk with the bank manager. We agreed the best action for us to take was to close the account and to reopen another account with a different account number. I was told that the fraud department was going to open an investigation based on my complaint into this matter. I want it to be known that I, in no manner, was to blame for the actions of this fraudster 's actions. I reported exactly what occurred because I knew I had been scammed. Fortunately, no money was ever transferred and this criminal act was stopped because of the quick response that I took in making Bank of America aware of what had happened. Bank of America highly suggested that I contact XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and convey all of this information in order to clear my name so that I may return to a normal life using a checking account which I have been doing since XXXX. I ask that you please understand that criminals should not be allowed to ruin someones life because of the illegal activity they participate in to take advantage of honest, hard-working people they prey upon every day. I am not sure how to provide you with the actual phone message I have in my voicemail but I have that saved and will provide it to you if you can help me to do so. Thank you for your kind consideration in this manner. I hope you will take this information for what it is and determine that this was an attempt of a criminal trying to take advantage of an innocent victim who was simply trying to secure a loan and was not wise to the extent criminals will resort to.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Extremely brutal, acting secretly conspired, extremely dangerously, with no hesitation demonstrating outrageous power abuse at the Northwest Bank, bank manager XXXX XXXX. OnXX/XX/2019 he welcomed me with my translator and DPOA representative to do an international wire transfer and he did not tell at the beginning that we will need to come back on Monday, because at that point we could leave and just comeback on Monday. We have been sitting at his office for over 45 and up minutes to do paper work and after that he went to send the paper work for transfer to wire department. After his return he suddenly said that we will need to come back on Monday to sign the confirmation. He was acting strange. He said he needs to make a copy print of bank information for recipient. We felt like he is planning something and trying to do something bad to us. He did not give us a choice, he said it is requirement to get a bank information copy and went to do the copy. It took over 15 minutes. After that we felt something definetely is not right. He already put all the information on the system, so why he needs a copy of the bank information printed on paper? We asked for confirmation of wire transfer papers that he worked on and we spent over one hour, he said that he is not liable to give us anything. We came on Monday morning XX/XX/2019 little bit after XXXX XXXX. He was acting strange and definitely stretched the time and was acting busy with other employee XXXX. We have been waiting 2,5 hours and we asked how long does that process work, he said, he could not give us the time frame. He asked for best call number to call. He was acting like he and somebody else at the bank or maybe not at the bank thinking how do not do my wire transfer. We asked for information and rules for a wire transfer, for call number to that department that process wire transfers and may have questions to us, we asked to ask them to cal us if they have any questions. Every our request for that information was denied.It feels like with every our question the manager was getting annoyed and finally he called only me without my translator and representative and some man on the phone without introduction began telling me that the bank denied my request to do the wire transfer.My representative was not welcomed by manager and he tried to push her out. She asked the name of that person on the phone and they both refused to provide it. They refused to provide the valuable reason to deny to send wire transfer.This happens often when dishonest people hear the accent or knows that they can an advantage of my insufficient English, they do take an advantage. We felt that they want to do something with money that I already was late to send. Secret conspiracy, obstruction with false reason that bank trying to take care of me and prevent me from scammers was sound ridiculous and bank manager was look like a scammer that spy on me to target. What did they do for 2 and half hours keeping me in the dark and foolish around me and my representative. In the end the bank refused to give a cashier's check in my name to put it whenever I want to in my name, but he demanded to give the name of the other bank or person and refused to write it in my name. He said that bank cannot give me any cash at all. The manager was inconsistent and lied and demonstrated his unfair practices in front of other bank employee XXXX. He made us sick. How mentally unstable people can get such important job at the bank? We felt that bank might want that money to do something for the bank. He offered to get cash on Wednesday only.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is XXXX, XXXX and Transunion are damaging my credit with false information. Even though I have detailed the situation to them two times, they have chosen to ignore me. In 2015 I had a limousine service. One of my drivers wanted to own his own vehicle. I guaranteed a loan for him from XXXX. Months later, without my permission or knowledge, the driver turned the vehicle back to XXXX, and XXXX accepted it without my signature even though I had an economic interest in it. The first I heard about the situation was when XXXX sent me a letter demanding payment for the loss they incurred in resale of the vehicle. I was never given the opportunity to possess the vehicle and take over the loan obligation. Had XXXX advised me of the situation, I would have simply added the vehicle to my fleet, leased it to another driver and continued making the loan payments. Nevertheless, the credit reports from these three companies state that I defaulted on the loan to XXXX, thus substantially damaging me. Obviously, these companies have not acceptably investigated or considered the matter. Please help me!\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My complaint and gripe is regarding on-line giant, Ally Financial, previously known as XXXX ( an acronym for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). It's a US-based bank holding company organized in Delaware and headquartered in XXXX, Michigan. I was a sucker! I went to on-line banking for a few pennies more interest and it cost me {$2500.00}. Oh ... Ally didn't do anything illegal, they just removed the human side of banking and turned it and me into basically an ATM machine! Hopefully others won't fall into the same trap. THE STORY : 8 years ago I took the proceeds from the sale of my home ( {$250000.00} ) and purchased a Certificate of Deposit ( CD ) with 'new ' on-line Ally Bank. Their percentage rate was slightly higher. So instead of dealing with a local 'bricks and mortar ' bank that had a real human being sitting at the officers desk, I sold my soul to the XXXX and sent my quarter of a XXXX dollars off into cyber space ... AKA ... Ally Bank! For 8 years, I never made a withdrawal. For 8 years, I redeposited the interest back into the CD letting Ally keep every single penny. Fast forward 8 years and a family emergency popped up and I needed to withdraw the money out of the CD to cure the emergency. I contacted Ally and they informed me of the \" penalty clause '' that said it would cost me {$2500.00} to collect my own money that had been entrusted to Ally for the past 8 years. Oh.. I know it's legal for them to penalize me as they have ... I'm not arguing that point. My {$2500.00} is gone, probably into some bankers weekend slush fund. My gripe is, I had no one to go to to explain the human and personal side of my situation. There was no bricks and motor ... there was no human being on the other side of the desk at a local branch to plead my case to. All I got was an 800 number and a recording that basically said ... \" We're so sorry ... XXXX XXXX ''! The purpose of the penalty in these cases is prevent one from using the CD as a checking or savings account. For 8 years, I entrusted my money with Ally to invest and reinvest and do with as they pleased. I never made a withdrawal and always reinvested to interest with them. But when I had a personal problem, as humans often do, I got to see the hard cold reality of on-line banking. Turn on, tune in, drop dead! MY ADVICE : Don't do what I did. I was narrow mind and stupid. I never envisioned a family emergency arising down the road, only to have digital corporate America reach in my pocket and remove {$2500.00} of my hard earned money without a blink of the eye. There are banks on every corner in America with real human beings working in there, just like you and me, and will have some compassion and understanding when the need arises. You can bank of the fact ... that will never happen at Ally Bank!\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I am currently on a trip to Florida, hundreds of miles from my home near XXXX XXXX. When I landed it was late, past midnight, and I headed to check-in at a hotel with my debit card as my card for the room. When I arrived my debit card would not work and I soon found out that a fraud alert had been issued. I called USAA to clear the fraud alert and oddly, was not asked to confirm the transactions or anything like that, I was simply told that \" my card is now unlocked and I can unlock it through the automated system '' .. I will come back to that later. I went to use my card, thinking there would be no problem, and yet again it was declined. I called back and spoke to I believe the same person, who this time sent a text to my phone to confirm my identity. My debit card 's expiration was next month, so USAA had issued me a new card in what they called a \" mass issue ''. Somehow, that new card had become active and made my in-hand debit card useless. I had not received the new card. I spoke to four or five different people for hours. I was stuck at a hotel with nowhere to go and nowhere to stay. USAA placed me on hold time and again and I was told multiple things. I was told that the new debit card hadn't shipped yet. I was told it had shipped and that my wife must have activated the new card ( which was not only untrue, it was impossible because I had used my debit card successfully after she went to sleep and I was the one that got our mail that day before I went to the airport ). I was told that it could have been fraudulently activated, despite also being told it hadn't shipped. Coincidences aren't usually coincidences. It just so happened that my working card had a fraud alert and when I called to clear it my card couldn't ever work again? I don't think so. Something happened that caused this. What did the first representative unlock when I called since he reviewed no transactions on a fraud alert and did not verify my identity with a text? I don't know, but I was stuck, embarrassed, at a hotel with no way to get a room. They could not reactivate my card because somehow a new card had been activated. I honestly thought I would have to sleep on a bench at the airport until family could pick me up the next day. I demanded that USAA do something to make this right because I believed USAA had a problem that caused this. There was no possible resolution. I called the \" Executive Support Team '' the next day and while they were apologetic, they offered no help in me being able to get through the weekend with no form of payment available. I had money in my account, but no way to access it. I asked if they could send me money via XXXX XXXX? No. No options. When I said I wanted a formal complaint launched and for USAA to figure out what happened, I was told a \" verbal complaint '' would be logged.. but that is not a resolution. Basically, a member of 15 years was on his own to figure it out. Luckily, the lady at the hotel desk worked something out to get me a room or I would have been sleeping on that bench.\n",

XXXX XXXX XXXX Case No. XXXX Circuit Court For XXXX County, Maryland My late father had a reverse mortgage that illegally encumbered his 20-acre, mixed-use ( part residential & part commercial ) farm. FYI : a commercial cell tower on his property actually made it ineligible for a reverse mortgage, but the mortgage company ( XXXX XXXX now dba Reverse Mortgage Answers of XXXX, MD ) got him approved for a reverse mortgage anyway when it failed to mention the cell tower to the underwriter. FHA underwriting guidelines strictly prohibit reverse mortgages on income-producing properties ( i.e., no agricultural or commercial use ). The fact that the cell tower had a land lease that ended on XX/XX/XXXX had four tenants ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX ), and had more than 1000 feet of buried fiber optics for XXXX, made it commercial. Reverse Mortgage Solutions ( RMS ) foreclosed on the property despite being asked by state regulators at DLLR not to do so. RMS and its representatives engaged in fraudulent activities that made the foreclosure illegal : 1 ) RMS had numerous documents notarized by XXXX XXXX XXXX, who presented different signatures on her documents. Notaries are only supposed to use the signature they have on file in their state. 2 ) RMS used substitute trustees at the law firm of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to foreclose on the property.

The payments are automatically deducted from my bank account. To reduce the time that we are going to be obligated for this loan, we also pay an additional {$200.00} per month. Upon receiving the first statement from Regions it indicated that we were {$200.00} past due. On XX/XX/XXXX, I inquired with the bank about the past due amount on my account, I was informed by Representative XXXX ( XXXX ) that it did not really mean that the account was past due, but the bank had no other way to reflect the additional amount paid. Before the conclusion of the conversation, I requested a corporate number which he stated that he did not have but a representative would contact me within 10 business days. When I further asked for a reference number regarding the complaint I was making, XXXX assured me that a complaint had been filed about my concern regarding the negative connotation implied by a past-due amount on our account. Further, XXXX stated that they do not provide reference numbers for complaints filed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX, who stated that he was a Contact Center Senior, Regions Bank, XXXX. XXXX informed me that there have been numerous complaints from other customers and the bank is making efforts to change how additional money applied to a loan will be captured on the bank statements customers receive and that there is a minus sign indicating that the account is not past due should be sufficient to anyone viewing that bank statement. Further, XXXX stated that there is no timeline or projected date to change that misleading information on customer accounts. Not being satisfied with XXXX response, I requested to speak to his supervisor. XXXX transferred me to his Team Leader, XXXX. XXXX did not answer or was not available to answer, so I left her a voice message to call me. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX called me back at approximately XXXX. I was away from my phone, but she left me a voice message to call her back at XXXX. I returned the call at approximately XXXX, there was no answer. I then called the XXXX number and spoke with a person who stated that her name was XXXX and that she was a supervisor at Regions in XXXX, Tennessee ( we are located in XXXX, Georgia ). XXXX transferred me to the Loan Department. I spoke to XXXX. XXXX suggested that in the memo section of the check I should put apply to principal. However, when I informed her that we were paying the additional money online and there is no memo section, she did not know how to handle the situation. I asked to speak to a manager. After attempting to reach the manager unsuccessfully, XXXX stated that she would leave a message for him ( XXXX XXXX ) and that I should receive a call-back within 10 business days. As of the date of this letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I have not received a call from him. Finally, it should be obvious at this point how difficult it has been trying to navigate the Regions banking system for customers. We are thoroughly displeased with the general practice of, posting additional funds to a loan account as past-due and want you to change it immediately! Please contact me at XXXX XXXX XXXX or in writing with your plan of action to resolving this situation. Respectfully Submitted, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/XXXX, a lease agreement for XXXX XXXX XXXX was signed with US Bank. Exhibit # 1 According to box # 4 from the agreement, the first payment of {$320.00} was collected on the Lease date, followed by 35 payments of {$320.00} due on the 31st of each month. The first payment was made by the credit card a few days in advance, XX/XX/XXXX. Exhibit # 2 On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a welcome letter from US Bank with account # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I made my second payment of {$320.00} On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from US Bank indicating that my account number has been changed from XXXX to XXXX for a strange reason ( Due to an internal processing error ).

Exhibit # 4 On the same date I called US Bank and according to the representative I still need to make one payment On XX/XX/XXXX I started my own research ; download all transactions form the US Bank website and compare to my records. Exhibit # 5 Results are very straight forward ; US Bank recorded 35 transactions which I made in the past three years but did not include the first one which I made on XX/XX/XXXX, during the lease contract initiation.

After keeping me online for more than 40 minutes he agreed to transfer me to the supervisor XXXX XXXX, phone # XXXX XXXX. As always happened, she was busy to answer my questions and he promised that she will call me back shortly. In approximately 40 minutes XXXX calls me and advice that US Bank, in fact, made a mistake by not including my first payment. He also said that I can ignore my recent bill.

After this happened I was denied an auto loan from the local banks. I started receiving past due bills from stores I have never heard of XXXX, we do not have a XXXX in Alaska. Stores with this type of names were unknown to me, and other bills that had a billing location of address out in Florida, I reside in Alaska. The only other encounter that I ever had was when I had co-signed a loan with a family member, and I will never do that again, because they had given the car to their other in-laws and the payments went into default so this happened for a few months, I immediately went to the bank and paid 3 months of back due loan payments for something that was not never in my possession, so I gave that approximately $ XXXX {$2000.00} out for free?!!? It has been well over 25 years now and I had records of clearing this with Federal Bureau of Investigations ( FBI ) way before this website was developed. I had to file a police report ( s ) either with the FBI or local Florida police and kept telling them the address ( es ) because this person who stole my identity was moving and relocating and continuing to destroy my credit history. I was told that anything beyond 7 years is cleared history of financial downfalls by the bank industry. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is what was told to me. I have re-established all of the credit history and have had problems and been overcoming them all.\n",

A few weeks later I got their results and I was told that invisalign would not make a difference on my teeth.

In XX/XX/XXXX the contractor sent me an email saying he wasn't going to complete the work and was filling bankruptcy. I contacted Citibank immediately and opened a dispute on the charge of approximately {$22000.00}. Over the next several months Citibank requested many items of information which I either faxed or emailed to them. In XX/XX/XXXX they stated they weren't going to be able to resolve my dispute because they didn't have my claim within 60 days of the last days I received services. This is not true. Being a remodel the contactor was working all the way to XX/XX/XXXX when I filed my claim. After not being able to get any assistance from Citibank by phone I opened a complaint with XXXX and I was contacted by XXXX XXXX at Citibank. XXXX worked on my dispute and the claim was supposed to go back to the merchants credit card company in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX when I still hadn't heard anything. He then stated that MasterCard refused to send back my dispute for the original same reason of last days services were'nt received in time ( which is not true ). I opened up a complaint directly to MasterCard who instead of speaking with me sent my dispute back to Citibank who then called me once again with the same reason on why they can't help me. I have lost {$22000.00} despite giving Citibank and MasterCard all information requested within time frames requested and am not getting a resolution that I should have coming to me. The only fair resolution is I should receive a full refund for services not received.

XXXX Dear Ms. XXXX XXXX, Re : Account Number XXXX First, I want to thank you for your services and kind support to both myself and my wife, XXXX in regards to our dispute relating to the above account. As per our conversation on XX/XX/XXXX, please find the attached documents in support of our dispute. It is clear that we made a payment online XX/XX/XXXX for said month ( see attached ), but the portal system scheduled the payment for XX/XX/XXXX. We have no control over when they get the money from our bank ; in this case they got the money XX/XX/XXXX. Even though the payments are due the XXXX of each month, XXXX XXXX allows us to make payments up to the XXXX of each month without penalty ; that is 10 days after the due date ( see attached example ). In this case the month of XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX got the payment 9 days after the due date, of which is XX/XX/XXXX We have in the past, made payments on the XXXX of some months and was not penalized. ( see coloberated bank statements attached ). This time their credit dispute department report our payment as delinquent to TransUnion, just 7 days after they received the payment, and as a result our credit score has been seriously damaged ( see attached ). Since then, we reached out to them verbally and in writing aimed at a fair resolution but they adamantly assured us they will not make any changes to their reports to the credit bureaus. I am now preparing a complaint to report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the XXXX, and the credit bureaus, but will not file it before the next seven days, in case your intervention makes a difference ( hopefully ). Thanks once again for your time, goodwill and effort in this matter. We do appreciate you, regardless of the outcome knowing you can only do so much in cases of this nature.

      "VALUE OF S is I have requested every month since XX/XX/2018 that Experian and XXXX remove the public record information of the bankruptcy on my credit reports. Both of the credit reporting agencies have responded several times that they received information from the US Bankruptcy Court and the record is VERIFIED and ACCURATE. The attached documentation from the US Bankruptcy Court clearly states that they do not report or verify information with credit bureaus. They also state that agencies do not contact the court to verify bankruptcy filings. A credit reporting agency is required by law to the following : ( 1 ) Guidelines. The Bureau shall, with respect to persons or entities that are subject to the enforcement authority of the Bureau under section 621 ( A ) establish and maintain guidelines for use by each person that furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information relating to consumers that such entities furnish to consumer reporting agencies, and update such guidelines as often as necessary ; and ( B ) prescribe regulations requiring each person that furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency to establish reasonable policies and procedures for implementing the guidelines established pursuant to subparagraph ( A ). 624 - 15 U.S.C. 1681s-3 97 ( 2 ) Criteria. In developing the guidelines required by paragraph ( 1 ) ( A ), the Bureau shall ( A ) identify patterns, practices, and specific forms of activity that can compromise the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies ; ( B ) review the methods ( including technological means ) used to furnish information relating to consumers to consumer reporting agencies ; ( C ) determine whether persons that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies maintain and enforce policies to ensure the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies ; and ( D ) examine the policies and processes that persons that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies employ to conduct reinvestigations and correct inaccurate information relating to consumers that has been furnished to consumer reporting agencies. My results from these credit agencies now state that XXXX XXXX provided the information. Where did XXXX XXXX get this information if the bankruptcy court states that they do not verify the information with third party vendors or credit agencies. All information collected needs to be verified with the Bankruptcy court directly and must be detailed and accurate, if not they are in violation of my rights. I need these items to be removed immediately, as this organization has not followed, reasonable procedures. It is the purpose of this letter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, ACCURACY, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information.\n",

I applied for a card, my application was approved and I paid $ XXXX+tax= {$630.00} with the card. Later it turned out that they is lied. Instead of issuing a statement credit of 10 %, they have promised to issue certificates worth of {$55.00} ( LESS THAN 10 $!!! ) that can be used only to make purchases in Best Buy. I called the credit card company and talked to a representative and then to a supervisor. They refused to offer a satisfactory resolution. I said to them that I am not planning to shop in Best Buy any time soon. I said they must disclose in their offer that the reward points can be used only to get certificates for making purchases in Best Buy. This was not disclosed in their offer ( their offer is attached ). If I knew that I can only get certificates to use them in Best Buy, I would never apply for this credit card.

      "VALUE OF S is XXXX was a website I used with my XXXX driver account to have access to my funds instantly, if needed. In XXXX of 2018 they had a processing issue which resulted in an overpayment to me on their end. I was not aware of the overpayment, so when the company attempted to draft the \" money owed back, '' XX/XX/2018, I called them and requested an option to make payments. This request was denied and I was told that was not an option. I told them I was revoking my authorization for XXXX payments. I placed a stop payment through my bank on the company. They attempted to draft again on XX/XX/18 and again yesterday, XX/XX/18. I used the chat option today to request they remove my banking information and again stated they do not have authorization to draft funds. I was told they will not remove my banking information or stop the draft attempts. I am sending in a written revocation letter to them and my bank today, but it was my understanding that they have to allow multiple payment options and ACH/EFT can not be required as the only means of payment. Furthermore, I was under the impression that if I revoke permission for them to attempt to draft from my account, they are no longer allowed to attempt said drafts.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is XXXX XXXX XXXX is reporting a debt on my credit file that I do not owe. I paid the total debt off. Last I checked I had no remainder balance. I did not receive phone calls, letters or any notification of any remaining balance. They are in violation of my 30 day right to dispute.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is The issue I have is with XXXX XXXX. When I pulled my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed they removed a credit bureau reporting they made on my acct for a 30 day past due notice on my record for XX/XX/XXXX and they changed it to show as 30 days late for XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and asked them why they had changed the date of this late payment reporting and the rep I spoke with seemed very confused and could not give me a clear answer of why this happened. Then, I pulled my credit report again on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed XXXX XXXX had put back the 30 day late reporting on my credit report for XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX XXXX nor Experian ( the credit reporting agency this was reflected on ) ever sent me a notice once this negative item was reinserted back on my credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Experian about this matter to see why they never sent me a notice once this late payment was put back onto my credit report and the rep with Experian also acted like he was confused and told me he did not know if it was XXXX XXXX or Experian who initiated this removal and reinsertion of the late payment on my credit report. The Experian rep also claimed he could not actually see where the late payment had been removed and then put back onto my credit report. I feel the reason everyone with XXXX XXXX and Experian are acting confused is because no one wants to take responsibility to fix this issue. As a result of the XX/XX/XXXX late payment being removed from my credit report, I want it removed again and this time permanently. Another issue I have with XXXX XXXX is that I wrote them two letters disputing the late payments they have reported on my credit report for the months of XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and they just want to keep being stubborn and refuse to remove the negative items or show me proof that my payments were actually late for those months and I requested that they send me proof in my letters to them and they just continue sending me their same generic letter saying they will not remove the items since their records show it is reporting correctly. And their most recent letter does not even address all the months of late payments I disputed with them, but they only mentioned how they corrected the error they made when they showed my account late for XXXX. They say they must report everything accurately according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but yet due to all of the mistakes they have made, that is not what they are doing and I am sure they have probably done this to others as well. The reason I am disputing all of the late payments they reported on my credit report is that when I review my payment history on the XXXX XXXX website, it clearly shows my payment due date is on the XXXX of each month and this is also what XXXX XXXX told me many times over the phone. And when I review my payment history, I can see where I have been late maybe 10 days or so, but some of the months they reported me as being 30 days late, do not appear to actually be 30 days late based on my payment dates compared with their established due date. For example, I made two payments in XXXX ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), but they reported me as 30 days late for that month and the previous month, I made my payment on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called a representative with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to have them explain this, they just tell me to file a dispute with the credit bureaus. I told them I already did that and they rejected my claim saying the late payments were accurate and since that doesn't make sense to me based on what I see, I am calling them to get an explanation. I spoke with a supervisor with XXXX XXXX who had a very nasty attitude and kept telling me that she is not a credit specialist and that I should just file a dispute with the credit bureaus. I told her I don't expect her to be a credit specialist, but I do expect her as a supervisor with this credit card company to explain my payment history and why they may be reporting it as late. Then the XXXX XXXX supervisor starts telling me how they go by the billing cycle when determining if payments are late and I told her this is the first time I was hearing this and every other time I called, I was told that my payment due date is on the XXXX of each month and that is also what is shows on their website. It just seems they want to justify themselves refusing to make this right. I will upload my supporting documentation to this complaint showing my payment history with XXXX XXXX, my dispute letters to them and their responses. I would also like Experian to be investigated for their part in the way the issue was handled with the late payment for XX/XX/XXXX being removed and then placed back onto my credit report.\n",

I still had enough to cover all pending and posted items and still charged me an overdraft fee. I have had numerous problems with this and have had to get the charges reversed. Some they would not reverse because my ending balance they say was not enough to cover pending charges. This I do not feel is right.

I asked if she was told about my situation and she said \" yes '' at which point I asked her to please not waste more time then and help me resolve this. She confirmed the payment of settlement was updated the day after I called in which was XX/XX/XXXX. She also didn't know what was reason for my Experian Credit reporting being flagged by her company. Who does know? Ms. XXXX then asked if I disputed the account and when I told her no, she brought up that I did so in XXXX. So I felt compelled to remind her that this was XXXX and that I was talking about why my account was being flagged in the present. At this point, she said that if I \" paid the full amount owned on account that they would report to credit bureaus immediately ''. Really? So again the only solution to problems in this country is paying more and more and more right? I'm not even going to get into what's going on in my family right now but I have to pay for a funeral and I'm not in any state of mind to be on the phone with people that represent these companies. I have to pay for a funeral and I have to pay for my own XXXX in XXXX So I was just about to apply for a loan but this collection agency is flagging my credit to the point which it drops 79 points in two days after I pay my that something is wrong here and I would like to know why.

      "VALUE OF S is Transunion is charging me $ XXXX for some service that I never knowingly agreed to.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Due to the fact that we moved our residence, I did not receive my XXXX credit card bill where I made an unusual charge on XXXX XXXX for {$110.00}. When the XXXX statement arrived at the new address, I had forgotten about making the charge, so I didn't tell my husband ( he does the bill paying for the household ) and he never opened the bill, mistakenly assuming it was zero balance as it had been for many months. When the XX/XX/2019 bill arrived, my husband did open that and discovered the balance owed ( which now included two {$38.00} late fees plus interest ) and immediately paid the balance of {$180.00} on XX/XX/2019 via phone pay. The next day, we received a very curt letter in the mail from B of A dated XX/XX/2019 informing that my credit line had been reduced from {$16000.00} to {$500.00} due, in part, to current or past delinquency. WOW, such drastic action to take over a small missed payment. I have maintained an excellent credit rating with no other late payments with B of A or anyone else. I had this particular account for many years with no problems. Yet, because of one small mistake my credit line is decimated, {$76.00} of fees are taken on a {$110.00} balance, and now my credit standing is damaged. I wrote a letter to B of A explaining this very honest mistake that was made by a very good credit consumer and asked for one of the fees to be refunded and the delinquency to be rescinded from my credit report. I thought this was a very reasonable request. Instead, I received another curt response from B of A dated XX/XX/2019 stating that their information is accurate and they will not do anything. I am disgusted at the total lack of understanding or consideration of a very obvious mistake that happened for the most part due to our change of address, and that I am NOT a credit problem. The amount involved is miniscule, yet that damage my credit and charge me a penalty that is approx 75 % of the original owed amount. The kicker is that when we received our XXXX statement, there was yet another \" minimum interest '' charge of {$1.00} added, even though we had paid the XXXX statement balance in full and on time ( as noted previously XXXX. Is this {$1.00} charge even legal?? I am asking for the adjustment of my account to include a refund of late fees & interest charged, a reinstatement of my credit line, and most importantly ; removal of my delinquency status from the applicable credit bureaus. I HAVE BEEN HARMED BY THIS FAR MORE THAN I DESERVE TO BE GIVEN MY HISTORY AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES. Thank you!\n",

      "VALUE OF S is A debt collection agency known as XXXX XXXX XXXX, also known as XXXX claims that I owe debt. The debt includes {$510.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$490.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$350.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$510.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The creditor that originated the debt is known as XXXX XXXX of Florida. I tried to contact the creditor however, had trouble locating this business. I called XXXX on several occasions in regards to the debt. I explained that I am unfamiliar with the business that submitted me to collections and have never had services rendered from the creditor that is claiming the various amounts according to the specified dates. Furthermore, the debt collection letter indicates my first name correctly, however, the last name does not match with my actual last name. I contacted XXXX, to inquire about the debt and explained my concern. XXXX requested me to provide my social security number. I provided them with this information and then they explained that my social security number does not match with their records. Thus, they advised me to contact TransUnion. I contacted TransUnion to file a complaint against XXXX, explaining that the debt collection that is on my credit report does not match up with me, the individual. The debt collection letter has a totally different last name, not misspelled. Also, the social security number that XXXX, the debt collection agency, has on file does not match up with mine. Thus, my last name does not match up nor does my social security number. TransUnion 's investigation concluded that the information from XXXX is accurate. How can this be? The last name and social security number does not match my identity. In addition, I have never had services from the claiming creditor. In conclusion, the charges against me are fraud and TransUnion has done nothing to help me after I fully explained the same information as I indicated in this summary.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I purchased {$510.00} worth of merchandise with my store credit card on XX/XX/XXXX, under a promotion where I pay no interest as long as the merchandise was paid off within 12 months. I made a {$40.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I made another payment of {$45.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a {$100.00} payment. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a {$60.00} payment. Lastly, I made a payment of {$250.00} on XX/XX/XXXX totaling {$530.00}. I had tried to make the last payment on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, but the credit card company had canceled the payments. I have been in contact with this company FOUR times to dispute the charges on my account because my account states that I still owe {$230.00} and states I still owe {$190.00} towards the merchandise. The company states that I owe late fees with interest even though on the account it states that there is no minimum payment due since it's a \" 12 months no interest promotion ''. I had even been charged late payment fees on the payment they canceled.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/XXXX, my XX/XX/XXXX payment in the amount of {$2800.00} was not applied correctly. {$1200.00} Interest amount was due ; {$1500.00} Principal amount I paid applied. Ditech Billing Statement for XX/XX/XXXX showing amount due of {$1200.00} for interest. I called Ditech on XX/XX/XXXX and informed about the mishandling of the payment I made for the month of XXXX. The customer service representative argued that it was applied correctly. I asked for a manager and was told there is no manager available. I then submitted a message using the Message Center option online. I follow up on XX/XX/XXXX, using the Message Center option online. In between all these attempts to resolve and apply for my payments appropriately for XXXX, I continued and paid the XX/XX/XXXX payment given the refinancing is not completed. The payment for XX/XX/XXXX, was issued on XX/XX/XXXX. To show proof that my account was completely mishandled by Ditech, there was no XX/XX/XXXX, due to date billing statement sent to me. I am providing you copies from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX as a proof what was sent and able to obtain online. Meanwhile, XXXX, the new lender I was working with to refinance this loan, continued to work with Ditech. The payoff balance including interest per day amounted to {$380000.00}. The payoff process was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, and disbursement of loan money was done on XX/XX/XXXX. As you can see no adjustment made on payments I made for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Which resulted in higher loan balance and interest before the payoff. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another follow up using the message center. On XX/XX/XXXX, Ditech returned portion of the unapplied payments I made for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$2500.00}. However, the full amount that I was expected was not returned. No clear explanation of how they derive the refund amount of {$2500.00}. See below copy of the check. To date, Ditech has not responded or sent the remaining balance of my payments. The bottom line on this complaint is that there is no interest payment due to this loan given it was already paid off. Ditech needs to return the total amount that was not applied at the time this loan was paid off. The remaining balance owe to me amounts to {$2700.00} which includes the interest amounts for XXXX {$1200.00} and XXXX {$1200.00} along with the remaining extra principal that I was not applied and not included on the XX/XX/XXXX, refund in the amount of {$110.00} ( {$2600.00} extra principal payments not applied : XXXX {$1500.00} and XXXX {$1100.00} minus refund of {$2500.00} ). Total amount issued to Ditech for XXXX {$2800.00} and XXXX {$2300.00}. I am hopeful for your assistance to review and forward this matter to this institution. If you need additional information, please email me at XXXX. Attached is a copy of all pertinent documents for this complaint. Thank you in advance.\n",

They instead submitted the inaccurate information in the completed report to my prospective employer and put CONSIDER on the results which is 100 % not accurate and reflects my submission in a negative light to the prospective employer.

      "VALUE OF S is Im submitting this complaint with ALLY because my credit score was negatively impacted due to ALLY reporting a late payments against me. My credit report shows a late payment was reported during the month of XX/XX/XXXX. I was a loyal customer to ALLY ever since received my auto loan in XX/XX/XXXX and I always made my payments on time. I had the ability to pay my bill to ALLY for the month reported as late and I scheduled my payment to be withdrawn from my bank account on-time for that bill. ALLY either did not properly send a request for payment from my bank, or did and something prevented the money transfer to ALLY. I was never properly informed by ALLY about any impending or existing missed payments on my account for the month reported as late. I also never received any indication from my bank account of a returned item due to not having proper funds in my account to pay my bill to ALLY. I only found my original payment was not posted when I logged into my online ALLY account. I immediately paid my bill with my debit card and confirmed with my bank the following day to ensure the payment had successfully been transferred to ALLY. I'm only bringing this issue to the attention of others now because I did not know ALLY was reporting any payment as late to credit reporting agencies until I reviewed my credit report earlier this year. I have been negatively impacted when trying to apply for other forms of credit for over 4 years due to the late payment on my record caused by ALLY. Since this late payment is not the result of my wrongdoing, and due to the circumstances listed above, I respectfully request for ALLY to remove the late payment during the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Please consider my track record of on-time payments as proof I take my financial obligations seriously. If you have any questions, or require further information from me, please feel free to contact me at your convenience.\n",

I was told that the previous deleted transactions are not deleted and thus it won't allow me to pay on XXXX XX/XX/2019 so i can only pay on XXXX OR XXXX XX/XX/2019? What???? 6. Who architected, designed and implemented this useless system. Why it impacts me-my recast money should be in my mortgage account before XXXX of the month otherwise my recast will be delayed by 1 full month. It's a big deal for me.

The gal at the collection company did have my correct address but never, ever have they sent me a notice of this debt and in fact she said they had been sending it to some address in XXXX Colorado.

      "VALUE OF S is 1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX I was allowed early release from my lease by XXXX at XXXX apartment complex. 2 ) On XX/XX/XXXX my application for apartment rental at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was declined citing derogatory collections filed on my credit report. I ordered a copy of my credit report and found that Quality Recovery Service ( working with the aforementioned XXXX at XXXX XXXX ), had recorded debt owed in the amount of {$3300.00}, in error on my credit report. Quality Recovery Service later reduced this amount to {$1400.00} and later to {$330.00}, in an attempt to correct their error. 3 ) On XX/XX/XXXX I received a copy of a letter from XXXX at XXXX XXXX addressed to Quality Recovery Service informing them that I \" was allowed to move out without termination penalty ''. 4 ) On XX/XX/XXXX I wrote a letter to Quality Recovery Service asking them to remove the collections from my credit report, which was placed in error, and to send me an invoice from the correct amount owed ( for water bill not yet received at the time of moveout, and prorated rent. ) I indicated in that same letter that I'm will to pay any amount owed, but Quality Recovery Service has refused to removed the {$330.00} from my credit report. The problem is that I'm willing to pay this amount but not until they correct their error by removing it from my credit report and billing me! Even after I make the payment, the record on my credit report would only show paid in full, when they should not have placed any amount on my credit report in the first place. I am pleading with CFPB for assistance in getting Quality Recovery Service to first removed the error from my credit report then invoice me for the correct amount and If I refuse to pay, that is only when they should report a delinquency to credit reporting agencies. They can't just reduce the amount of their error, they have to reverse the error and invoice me the correct amount to pay!\n",
      "VALUE OF S is WE have opened different cases on how Wells fargo has violated our practiced. We spoke to XXXX XXXX but Resolution on the following have not been provided : DO NOT CLOSE CASE TILL RESOLUTION IS REACHED. ( 1 ) DUAL TRACKING with us by foreclosing on our home while we were going through modification process and speaking to their president 's office. ( escalation unit ) ( 2 ) PREDATORY LENDING with us by switching our CONVENTIONAL loan to INTEREST only loan after 9 years of living in our home with our children without our knowledge but by FALSIFYING my signature during request for 4 months loan modification ( short term hardship assistance ) into INTEREST ONLY WITHOUT OUR CONSCENT OR KNOWLEDGE THROUGH FALSIFIED SIGNATURE. We have lived here for 18 years. ( 3 ) UNFAIR LENDING PRACTICES that have diminished our personal credit standing ( 4 ) VIOLATION OF CONSUMER PROTETION STATUES AND REGULATIONS ( 5 ) Wells Fargo sold my home in XXXX through the practice of dual tracking. We sued wells Fargo, they agreed to settlement to reinstate our loan with some \" MANDATORY ARBITRATION '' But wells fargo did not fully reinstate my loan as settlement stated with the continuation of my original mortgage payment instead they inflated my monthly payment times 3. We have requested DETAILED HISTORY OF OUR PAYMENT ACTIVITIES SINCE OUR LOAN ORIGINATION DATE XXXX but Wells fargo only provided payment history from the year XXXX instead of the year XXXX to date. We have also requested our original loan amortization from the year XXXX but wells fargo has refused to provide that information. We asked for explanation of how our mortgage payment went from barely $ 2000+ to {$5800.00} a month, no one has given us an answer. We have complete documentations of evidence of dual tracking that we can forward directly to cfpb for review and audits We need answers to all these inquiries above and below. we also need wells fargo time to the same time that we gave them to review all documents and correspond with them before closing this case. 1 ) Dual Tracking : In XX/XX/XXXX, Wellsfargo was processing our loan modification without removing our property foreclosure. Agent were telling us documents to fax in which we did but foreclosure sale date was not moved or stopped. As foreclosure sale date was set, I was quoted {$120000.00} to reinstate the loan, take care of escrow balance ; attorney fees and all other delinquency fees. Provided Wells Fargo proof of funds from the bank to extend sale date or remove sale date but Wells Fargo proceeded to sell my property on XX/XX/XXXX, after speaking to my bank manager who confirmed availabity of funds. 2 ) We retained an attorney who sued Wells Fargo but Wells Fargo reached an agreement that if we should agree to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice, Wells Fargo will reinstate the loan as it was and credit all payments, past due escrow balance, taxes and insurance to bring account current with no extra charges. A payment of {$130000.00} as settlement amount. 3 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo signed the settlement agreement upon the receipt of {$130000.00} in lieu of rescind the sale, reinstate the loan to current status, take care of escrow account and resume account activities. 4 ) Wells fargo did not keep up their side of the deal because the payment of {$130000.00} was not properly credited to the account to take care past due escrow, payments, taxes, and insurance as was listed in the the detailed statement that was sent to us in XX/XX/XXXX regarding why {$130000.00}. 5 ) Wells Fargo did not reinstate the loan as it was where Wells Fargo pays our taxes and insurance as we had requested and how it was prior to settlement of lawsuit but instead Wells Fargo added forced escrow to our loan and did not provide detailed account of how and our payment of {$130000.00} was disbursed. This caused them to do wrongful escrow analysis on our loan thereby tripling our mortgage payments and making it unable for us to make our payments. 6 ) Wells Fargo also falsified interest only modification which we never requested and stated that our loan was an interest only loan when statements that was provided by Wells Fargo attorneys during lawsuit settlement in XXXX clearly showed our property as ARM and not interest only. 7 ) Our original loan was taking out in the year XXXX in the amount of {$240000.00}. As of today, Wells Fargo has turned our lives to a nightmare with the falsified interest only modification which puts our payoff amount to {$350000.00}, our monthly payment form {$1200.00} to {$5600.00}. We have asked wellsfargo to let us know what our monthly payment was before the modification and how many payments were we past due to have requested interest only loan from an arm and how much difference was our payments before interest only and after interest only loan because we never signed for interest only modification, it is falsified. We have lived in our home for 18 years, have XXXX children here. It is not an investment property to be interest only.\n",

XXXX failed to do so yet continues to illegally collect the debt and even filed a derogatory statement on my credit earlier this year. Even though, if the debt was legitimate all they would have to send is an itemized statement. They refuse as the debt is not verifiable. I personally went to collect the letter from the hospital directly and one doesnt exist. Fast forward to XX/XX/2019, I filed a complaint with my credit agency and XXXX removed the derogatory statement because they couldnt provide the necessary information. Proof attached. Now, without any more or new letters or proof sent they attempted to hurt my credit again but have changed the debt amount. Without any new contact or letter.

      "VALUE OF S is Hello, On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a citibank checking account using the promotion code : XXXX The terms are : Open a new Checking account and Citi Savings account in Citi Bank Account Package by XX/XX/2018. Within 30 days of the opening of the new eligible checking account, any owner of either eligible account must make a deposit of {$15000.00} or more in New-to-Citibank Funds into the new eligible checking account and/or the new eligible savings account. The remaining balance requirement may be deposited into either the eligible Checking Account or eligible Citi Savings Account. A minimum balance of {$15000.00} must be maintained for 60 consecutive calendar days following the date when the {$15000.00} deposit was made ( minimum balance ). On XX/XX/XXXX ( the 30th day ), I decided I would drive to the nearest branch and deposit the remaining funds to the nearest branch in XXXX, CT. Before making such a long drive, I decided to call to make sure that the deposit would still count towards the promotion. I called at XXXX XXXX and was told that the deposit would still meet the requirements if I made the deposit that day. Therefore, I decided that it a {$400.00} promotion was worth 3 hours of driving and roughly {$25.00} in gas. I made the drive and at XXXX XXXX deposited {$8000.00} in cash to the teller at XXXX XXXX. This brought our balance to {$15000.00}, over the required {$15000.00} deposit within the required timeframe of the promotion.. However, now I am being told that I did not meet the deposit within the required timeframe because the deposit was made on a Saturday and Saturday deposits are not counted till the following business day and that therefore I will not be receiving the bonus. This is frustrating, because I was assured on the phone, the day I made the deposit, that it would meet the requirements. No where on the original promotion did it say that weekend deposits do not count till the following business day. I have escalated my case twice via the phone with citibank representatives. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an electronic communication saying that I do not meet the requirements because I did not meet the deposit in the required time frame. On XX/XX/XXXX I tried to appeal the decision again, by mailing a letter and a copy of my phone bill indicating that I had spoke to a citibank representative prior to making the deposit. I received no response to this letter, and when I called to check on it in early XX/XX/XXXX no one seemed to have seen the letter. I was given a fax number instead. So on XX/XX/XXXX I faxed the same letter and phone bill showing that I made a call that day prior to the fax and indicating in my letter that I made the deposit on the 30th day even though they did not count the deposit till the following Monday. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and it was as if this letter was never received. I appreciate your assistance.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I have one personal checking account and six business checking accounts with Bank of America. I received letters regarding the six business accounts in late XXXX stating that BoA had decided to close my accounts for no particular reason other than a \" business decision '', as was told to me in a BoA branch today. The letters were dated XX/XX/2019, but since they were sent only via regular mail, I did not receive them until maybe XX/XX/XXXX. BoA made no effort to send the letters or termination notice via email, text message, or through their BoA online portal message center. The letters state that each account will be closed 30 days from the date of the letter. I went into a BoA branch today to 1. Find out why the accounts were being closed, and 2. to either move all funds into my personal BoA account, get cashier 's checks for each account, or wire the funds in each account to another financial institution. I was told, in person, today that all of the accounts are \" frozen '' and that no money can be transferred or withdrawn from any account. I was told that paper checks will be mailed to the address for each account within five business days of the accounts being closed. That means that I will probably not receive the checks until early XXXX - over three weeks from today. Rest assured that no strange activity has been going on in any of these accounts. They are all used to pay bills, like rent and utilities. I have had most of them for over five years. The most recent one was opened only a few months ago, in XXXX, XXXX. All of them are in good standing, have never been overdrawn, and the cumulative total cash balance of all six accounts is well over {$XXXX. It seems illegal that a bank can close an account for no reason whatsoever, and much more so, that they can hold a customer 's money against their will for several weeks with no explanation whatsoever than \" it's a business decision ''. There are no outstanding balances, unpaid bills or problems with any of the accounts. The cash is simply sitting in the accounts doing nothing other than making BoA money on the overnight interest rate profits. And no one can give me a reason why I can not withdraw it or transfer it to my personal BoA account. The accounts are not scheduled to be permanently closed until XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX. Today is XX/XX/XXXX, which is obviously several days before that deadline. But I have absolutely no access to the accounts to pay bills, transfer funds, or withdraw the cash. Is that not illegal?? I demanded my money in person today in a branch in XXXX, New York XXXX, and I was refused. I filed a complaint with Bank of America in that same branch, and I have left voice messages for the regional manager, who has thus far refused to call me back. Not having access to over $ 300K for over two weeks will cripple my company. I will not be able to pay staff or bills. Moreover, since BoA is issuing physical checks, the checks will no doubt take 30 days to clear and become available when I deposit them into new accounts at another bank. So, I will likely not have access to 99 % of that cash for at least 45 days from today. Is there some way you can demand that they release my funds immediately? And more so, take action against the bank to prevent them from treating other customers in such an abusive way?\n",

I am sick of them reporting bad info on my credit I have disputed them over 10 times and they keep adding money to my account increasing balance and interest is wrong also. They took insurance meant for car repair and kept and applied to loan. before the repo they took one payment for bumper damage of {$600.00} did not fix vehicle.

My XXXX payment was apparently \" lost '' by the Post Office, according to PayPal. I have never had a piece of mail \" lost '' in over 30 years. I spoke to a PayPal \" representative '' multiple times that month. It became obvious that I was speaking to employees of a contracted third party, and was given no option to speak to anyone in the billing department of PayPal itself. On XX/XX/2019, I purchased a money order from my local post office, and sent the payment through the certified option. I received the confirmation receipt that the payment had been to delivered to the P.O. Box in XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/2019. My payment is due the XXXX of every month. I checked to see if my payment had been processed multiple times over the next week, and it hadn't. I called PayPal on XX/XX/XXXX to see what was going on, and was given the same run around as in XXXX. Again, I was told it was a Post Office problem. On XX/XX/XXXX, my payment still hadn't been processed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them again, and was given the same run around, again. My payment was processed on XX/XX/XXXX, a full 12 days after it had arrived at their designated P.O. Box. Another {$38.00} late fee was charged to me. I spoke to another \" representative '' today, XXXX, XX/XX/2019, to find out why it had taken so long to process the payment, and to have the fee waived. I was informed that the fee would be waived as a \" courtesy, '' I still owed the inflated payment because of the late fee, and when asked who I need to contact to speak about billing and processing of payments, that there was nobody but his department. This is at the very least incompetence, or at worst, deliberate fraud ( theft. ) Either that P.O. Box is not being checked until someone complains, or these payments are being \" lost '' or sat on deliberately to incur late fees.\n",

I also asked that they release XXXX of the overall settlement up front as it states in their insurance claim processing documents. Both requests have gone ignored.

He informed me they were CLM, capital link management and were a mediation company and not the debt collector. The debt collector was actually XXXX XXXX. The representative stated he didnt have that in his system and i could email bank debit details via email to show my repayemts. I did decline as im not at all comfortable sending that type of personal information via email. I asked to be sent documentation via mail and they refused saying they could only send an email. He then put his supervisor on the phone and again i asked for documentation and he repeated the same that they could only send email and why hadn't i previously responded. He also stated that 95 % of the time there are no errors and its not normal that the debt would be paid and they not have that info. I told him i just received the call and that when it referred to garnishments i contacted them back immediately. I have no issues dealing with debt or owed funds but for them to mention garnishments and or judgements without any prior notification of court and or subpoena is ludicrous. And they are not the creditor to threaten such action but only a mediation company at that to make that threat is simply outrageous. I shouldnt be threatened of garnishments to scare me as a consumer to payment. The supervisor said they dont do regular paper mail because of turn around time and proceeded to send me a letter of discussion of agreements in which our conversation we agreed to no such payment. I only requested documents proving and or outlining the debt. The email was a letter stating i agreed to pay when i did not. What profesional company that is debt collection and or mediation does not send official mail?\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I have a complaint with Synchrony Bank, regarding my CareCredit account. First, I will admit I have been delinquent on my account and I am not denying I have fallen behind regarding even my minimum payments. After living in XXXX XXXX for 20 years, I moved out because it has become too expensive to live there over the years. I moved to the outer area of XXXX, OH, and living with my elderly father to assist him since he is alone but does not need a caretaker. After I arrived, I attempted to call Synchrony to make payment arrangements to make some payment on my account. I had received a letter regarding that my account had been forwarded to a collections agency. On XX/XX/18, I attempted to call the collections company, but no luck as the agent I was talking to didnt seem to understand English as I had repeated my name five times - even spelling it, and the person still could not comprehend what I was telling him or her, for I couldnt tell. Frustrated, I then called Synchrony Bank directly to make contact and was able to get through. The person I spoke with understood me and seemed like she knew what she was doing, not an offshore call center and she sounded older. I let her know my financial situation at the time, that I would be making payments on my account but I wasnt exactly sure when exactly I would be making them. But at least one {$100.00} payment on my account in the next month. She continued to notate on my account, and asked me if I could make two payments around certain dates ; I agreed to making two payments in the month of XX/XX/2018. I gave her a ballpark idea of dates since I was unemployed ; she set actual dates I needed to make payment by : XX/XX/18 and XX/XX/18, but never let on as those being exact set dates. This whole time, I stated with the assumption I was making an old school, promise-to-pay on my account and that I would be making the two {$100.00} payments myself online, not permitting Synchrony to automatically take two {$100.00} payments in XX/XX/2018 on set dates. She also verified my account information, including my checking account was still the same. So thinking I was late with my first payment, I made an online payment myself XX/XX/18 to Synchrony for {$100.00}. A few days later XX/XX/18, another payment for {$100.00} was processed by Synchrony automatically and not by me. I didnt notice this for at least a week, and was baffled how that happened. I went online XX/XX/18 and removed my checking account information to prevent this from happening again since {$200.00} was paid as promised by then. Days after I removed my bank information, another {$100.00} payment was processed on XX/XX/18 by Synchrony. As soon as I caught this on XX/XX/18, I called Synchrony to file a complaint and have the payment credited back to me as financially this put my checking account in the red. I told them I never authorized for them to automatically take money out of my account for payments and that I agreed to make the two {$100.00} payments myself online. I was transferred over to a supervisor, but the issue was not resolved at that moment as the blame seemed to be put on me by her, and that if I verified my account information including my checking account information, that I was authorizing them to automatically process payments to my Synchrony account. I was also told that my complaint would take 30 days to investigate before I would be considered for a refund. I asked how could they legally still process a payment if I had removed my checking account information from my profile, but no clear answer was given except that I had verified my checking account information and thus permitting money to be withdrawn by Synchrony. Weeks later, I called back Synchrony and told them to stop my claim as that third payment would cover me for XXXX payment, even though I did not approve for them to automatically take it from my checking account. This call was to an offshore call center, and agent assumed if you are not working you can collect unemployment. And of course, they asked for more payment. Also did not receive anything in writing from Synchrony in regard to these payments nor any emails. So basically at this point, I am apprehensive to make payment to Synchrony because of this that occurred. I would think what they did was wrong on their part. Please investigate the practices of Synchrony CareCredit, so this does not happen again. And if I was wrong, then I understand but I know from my perspective what my intentions were.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Company is reporting incorrect information about me and/or my current status. It has placed wrong discriminatory information on may account listing my status as \" Retired '' This occurred during an error by a so called soft inquiry which was supposed to have no effect on my credit report. The company is working directly with creditors ' and/or has a conflict of interest. They are willfully involved in the \" Unfair Credit Score Shell Game Scam ''. and/or doing everything possible place me in a category that is derogatory degrading and/or deformation of my character. It dose not reflect my creditworthiness ' my low credit utilization rate, my actual situation, assets, income to debt ratio, my income to credit ratio. They are profiling against me because I am doing proper management low credit utilization rate by not having a bunch of credit cards and/or managing lower interest rates. They make it as there are no payment history on prior mortgages. They profile against me because all my prior Mortgage loans and credit cards used where paid in full then close which is part of my management of my income to debt ratio and/or low credit utilizations. The entire system of the \" Unfair Credit Shell Game Scam '' is very dangerous and as we been reporting unhealthy for economics it does not reflect the most important things in reference 's to creditworthiness and can easily be abused at the cost of everyone. For example its not based on your assets, borrowing then paying back in full. Its based on a impossible to prove accuracy models called \" Credit Scores ''. Let me give you an example. A person who has no assets, does not have income and/or any mortgages. They go and get two credit cards they use them to do everyday purchase 's for example to pay bills, food, gas etc. They keep them below 30 % their \" Unfair Credit Score Shell Game Scam ''. Will quickly go to the 800 's and that is because of a model that is designed for disaster and is like a bubble that will burst especially during toxic times and/or in the current economical times. They then go for the gusto full blown amount then they beat the creditors or fail to pay. The walk away with the money that they got and/or sold off the assets obtained by the credit cards. Note this is a common tactic used by XXXX XXXX etc. Then what occurs? There are no assets they don't have any income and/or never should of been granted the credit in the 1st place this is exactly what occurred during the housing crash that was the purpose of creating the CFPB. Those that benefited from that are hedge funds who had insurance on the failure of the same loans which they sold to some investor who lost and/or the same entities we are complaining about. I know of such people who no way should qualify and have very high \" Credit Score Shell Game Scam ''. This must be addressed especially in such economics. Its forcing those who have not done those things and are able to maintain things from not doing anything. They are not buying properties, cars etc. because like me they refuse to have a higher debt to income ratio as well as pay ridiculous interest rates while the rates are so low. This whole \" Credit Score Shell Game Sham '' needs to be addressed we have relentlessly been trying to get it addressed. I will be ok and survive as my actual history proves why because of my proper managements and/or my continued services to this nation. These colors red white and blue never fade nor do they run from any battle. In fact I run towards them be they ; wars in a real military 's branches not some rag tag extremist XXXX XXXX being funded by the very same entities we are complaining about and/or their enablers. Be it the war on Covid19 or any other war you will find I ran to it and registered with the proper authorities and/or honest decent people government agencies and/or lobbied for change. We again compel anyone reading these reports to do the correct thing and assist me in doing something about it to bring a positive change and work hand in hand with the current government and/or any other future government 's to avoid crashes and help make it so the average responsible person is not a victims of the \" Unfair Credit Shell Game Scam ''. We must do all we can to get things flowing again and always try to help others in the process be it by making affordable hosing helping them during hard times and working with anyone who is doing the correct things. Enjoying in good and forbidding evil. Even if its helping just one person it matters. This life time span can not be measured when you compare to to forever try to do that math. We will be held accountable if not here then in the hereafter. Anyone reading this will not be able to say a XXXX did not come to them about that. The score we should all be worried about the most is that one. Thank you for reviewing this complaint.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I was stupid enough to charge some items at MACY 'S on my Macy 's credit card over XXXX. I was unable to log into my account online to make the payment because Macy 's had updated the system and I simply did n't have the patience to navigate their irritating and obscure system. However, I called Macy 's and paid my bill for $ XXXX a day or two late - was assured that there would be no late charges because I was a customer in good standing, yada yada, and received a confirmation number that I had paid the bill in full. I then received a bill for {$2.00} in interest. OK, I agree - I had n't paid the {$140.00} on time, regardless of the reason. Whatever. So I paid that {$2.00} bill immediately, by check, and left the country for an extended absence - in complete confidence that I had paid all my bills in full. Imagine my surprise when I returned to the US and found that Macy 's had received and cashed my check, but charged me a further {$2.00} anyway as a minimum interest charge on the interest charge that had been paid in full, well before the due date. Oh, and then added a further minimum {$2.00} charge for a total of {$4.00}, due on XXXX. I called Macy 's right away and spoke to one XXXX, who did n't seem to have a clue why I was irritated, but eventually - very grudgingly and with full implication that I was a total deadbeat - agreed that she would \" waive '' the {$4.00}. Imagine my FURTHER surprise when I received a FURTHER email from Macy 's about my \" account balance. '' I immediately called, went through endless voice prompts, and finally got through to a live human being who said in hushed tones that she 'd have to put me through to another department. Sure enough, I got the \" this is an attempt to collect a debt '' speech. The glorious XXXX, according to the faultlessly polite CS rep who answered, had failed to properly credit my account. He agreed that he could correct it and that my account would update eventually to show a {$0.00} balance. However, he was unable to reassure me that this, um, \" delinquency '' had not been reported to the credit bureaux that make a darn good living off selling my info, and he could not send me a letter saying that Macy 's had made a mistake. Given that the glorious XXXX had also assured me that I had a {$0.00} balance on my Macy 's charge card, forgive me if I 'm not confident that I do in fact now have a {$0.00} balance. I do not give a flying whatever about my credit as I am old and cranky and do n't need any credit. I DO care that Macy 's total incompetence and the Macy 's system that is set up to fail, to their benefit and to consumers ' detriment, affects kids and other people who DO need good credit.\n",

After I inserted the bills the atm proceeded to count the money ( or thats what I thought XXXX, flashed a quick error message on the screen and spit back out a XXXX XXXX XXXX. The screen said thank you for banking with us and went back to its Home Screen after spitting my card back to me. I immediately checked my account balance on my phone and the {$1900.00} that I didnt receive was not credited to my account. I then called the number on the atm and got in touch with someone and explained my situation. While I was on hold I put my atm card in the machine to select the deposit option to see if it would open and I could possibly get my money out. Wishful thinking. It wouldnt even let me select the deposit cash option on the screen. By this time I was back on the phone with a different person. I explained to the the situation and they told me they would help me open a claim. I drove from the atm into the banks parking lot, gave all my information for the claim and was told XXXX days this issue should be resolved. To be proactive I also called the bank branch where the incident happened the morning they opened. I explained my situation to the gentleman who answered the phone and he told me that I would have to submit a claim over the phone and that there was nothing that he could do. I gave them a little over XXXX days and was told by another person on the phone that I received the wrong information and that it would take at least XXXX days for this matter to be solved. Fast forward to the XXXX day I was told my claim was denied bc there were no overages in the atm at the end of the week. Not accepting losing out on {$1900.00} I asked what I was supposed to do they told me I could make another claim. Which I dont understand what that is going to do if they already denied the claim.

XXXX then decided to take the charge off record on my credit report that was the other bank 's response to our ongoing dispute and apply that to my banking accounts with XXXX. This shows that even if a dispute is ongoing and the one bank has nothing to do with the other they will take ONE CREDIT REPORT ( Experian ) and based their decision about my active accounts at another bank on that. NOT my banking behavior with XXXX. My banking actions with XXXX are nearly spotless and have been for 10+ years.

      "VALUE OF S is I have filed complaint after complaint with you, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dealing with Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ), and for some reason, you think it is sufficient if they simply respond to the complaint. It doesn't matter if that response is a lie, or even illegal. This company and their parent company has been sued by, and have had complaint after complaint filed against them with the United States Government and the Department of Justice. XXXX XXXX has settled with the DOJ several times including this time XXXX XXXX Agrees to Pay {$5.00} XXXX in Connection with its Sale of XXXX XXXX XXXX. But yet, they continue with their same practices to foreclose on the homeowner. I received a modification in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX when they settled due to the guidelines placed by the Department of Justice. But shortly after, they raised my mortgage by {$200.00}. Then I received another notice in XXXX that they are raising it again! I fell behind and tried and tried for modification and no help. They receive credit from the Department of Justice, but they don't report that they turn around and raise those rates back up behind the DOJ 's back, claiming escrow shortage. My insurance and taxed did not increase by {$400.00} in the last two years. I have paperwork for proof. The DOJ gives credit for this? Even though it's misleading? You continue to let this company illegally take homes and do business in the U.S. when you know what they are doing is illegal. If you didn't think it was illegal, why file complaint after complaint against them. And for whatever reason you settle. I am a single mother who was caught up in the XXXX housing crisis. I was taken advantage of then, and continue to be by SPS. Never mind the fact that the assignment claim they filed on my property was filed 2 years after it was supposedly signed. And the supposed manager on the account was never a manager. She is willing to testify in court on my behalf. They continue and repeatedly say that my note holder is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but when you contact them, they have no knowledge of me or my loan, or my SSN. No information regarding me. During the crisis those mortgage assignment and securities where under scrutiny and had a complaint filed against them for those same practices! They have no record of me. And they fraudulently send this through USPS mail knowing it's a lie. How is that not a federal crime? They continue to say that I have a relationship team manager. Virginia has yet to call me! I have yet to talk with her. She is never available. It is always someone else calling me from SPS. They call at XXXX while I'm at work. And if I don't answer, there is a note on my door saying they are trying to get a hold of me. Never mind the fact that I just talked to them the day before. And they will charge a few for that saying they are trying to locate me. Tell me why they continue to do this, when there is a currently lawsuit against them by another client ( I won't include his name ) for the exact same practice. Why does the XXXX Government let them get away with what they do? They are doing the same practices that led to the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX housing crash and crisis. I'm a victim that struggles to keep her home due to XXXX 's practices. They offered a repayment plan that was triple my original mortgage rate for 12 months! That they claim is to bring me current. How would you expect me to afford a {$1400.00} mortgage payment for when I tried to modify from the near {$900.00} payment they bumped it up to, due to \" escrow '' shortages? I do not want a big packet in the mail from SPS regarding this matter. I want the truth and that's it. They repeatedly threaten with foreclosure to get someone out of their home. If you, the cfbp would look back at the complaints ... how is that so many consumers have the exact same complaint about the same company and you do nothing about! I have not received anything regarding their decision to not modify, of when they discussed anything w/ my lender or not holder. Does a SPS make those decisions on their own? Why is there never a representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the courtroom? If SPS wants the home, then I'm sure they will find a way to take it. They have yet to explain to me why my {$700.00} payment was not posted from XX/XX/XXXX. The latest court filings and none of them actually, because they have tried to foreclose numerous times, contains the same paper work attached. It's always different. The assignment is in some and not in all. The loan amounts are different. The loan number and account numbers aren't always consistent. It's a sham and SPS, The DOJ, & the cfpb all know it. But with the current president, banks and creditors can do whatever they please to the consumer with no consequences. As long as they make their money. I have even attached that document to my complaint with you all before. One representative said since it had redaction that they couldn't take it. I do not have to show SPS my full bank statement. They only need to see payments to them, and my income. They never even asked for income which increased by over $ XXXX/month in their latest denial for assistance. Legally they are supposed to show the numbers that they used. The denial only showed where they pulled comps in my area. There was no income calculated. No communication between the holder and SPS which is necessary by law. No true NPV calculated. No explanation of how much cash flow my investor would receive from a modification verses a foreclosure. To say I'm terrified for myself and my children is an understatement. Select Portfolio Servicing please do not send me another huge packet in the mail. Electronic will suffice.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is placed freeze on my credit report some time ago. for the last couple of months, i have been trying to release the freeze. i have went online to experian website and i have called them. There automated system does not give you the option to release a freeze even though the website indicates that you can release a freeze by calling. it only gives you the option to place a freeze. the website does not allow me to release the freeze because they have incorrectly input my address information. I have reported this issue before and right after cfpb addresses it with experian, they put my address back to my old address. Nothing but liars and crooks in Texas. I want them to release the freeze on my experian credit and to put my personal information as it should be. i should not have to further compromise myself by sending the copies of social security cards and id in the mail. I have police reports of mail being stolen. why would i send them sensitive information like that and they don't send it back. Who know what they do with the information. If they would put my information back to what it should be, this would probably not be an issue. They have even previously sent me credit reports showing that they put it back and them they turn around and put my old address as my current address. I live in XXXX. Not XXXX XXXX.

      "VALUE OF S is I have a public record ( CHAPTER XXXX BANKRUPTCY ) entry that was placed on my credit report and I have been trying for over 12 months to get this entry removed. I have spoken with numbers representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how Transunion verifies their public records was advised it was via third party not actual court. I want to know this information because the public record keeps coming back as mine. I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through XXXX. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. I advised that I would like to cancel that dispute and they advised that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact them with my name and the case number. Being that I work for a law firm, I know the court system and their procedures, but decided to call anyway. Contacted the court and they advised that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. I decided to call Transunion back, spoke with another rep this time and they advised that the information is verified by the runner who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus. Transunion refuses to give my physical documentation ( whether tangible or electronic ) that they use to verify this these accounts are mine. It is reporting invalidly and would like it to be removed immediately.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is An account with Greensky Trade Credit , LLC XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA was established for financing a home repair project via XXXX. I never received a bill for the completed project therefore, I had to personally contact the establishment to inquire. During my telephone conversation with Greensky, I was directly told the specific reason was directly due to an improper mailing address. They further stated that the correspondences had been returned to them a period of five months had elapsed. XXXX financed the project via Greensky. Therefore, there are two addresses listed on all documents. There are a physical address of the property and are my mailing address. These addresses were established at the initially from the onset of financing the construction. I repeatedly asked a representative of the company during my conversation with her why an invoice had not been sent. She justified action due to an incorrect mailing address. Prior to ending the conversation, I was told that an invoice would be mailed. To date, I have still not received the documents. A day after my conversation with the company representative I received an email alert notification of an adverse thirty-day delinquent credit report. In addition, a second adverse repot was listed on my credit report. An individual from the company whom identified as XXXX telephoned and left me a voice message in references to the account. The voice message directed me to return the telephone call. Upon retrieving the message I immediately returned the call. However, I did not speak with XXXX directly but another representative. I provided the reason I was calling and an email for any additional communications. The representative assured me that the message would be relayed and I left a voice message to ensure full communication of the issue. The company still refuses to provide me an invoice and any additional documents but they are being allowed to submit two adverse thirty-day delinquent credit reports.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is There's a common practice with credit card companies that affect people with money problems. 1. they offer a balance transfer if you open a new card. 2. they ask you how much you make per year. ( without any evidence, people can lie and inflate their income ) 3. the company accepts your application and balance transfer. The promotional period is generous- around 13 months in this case ( Bank of America platinum ). 4. After the promotional period, the rate rises to 24 %. This is a loan shark rate that is impossible to pay back for most middle- low-middle class people. 5. HERE 'S THE KICKER : After approving your application, mailing your card, emailing an announcement that your card has been mailed, they delay the balance transfer payment to the other card TWO WEEKS. Your balance remains at XXXX for two weeks. This practice ( mailing the card, delaying the balance transfer and keeping your full credit line open at {$0.00} ), is designed to lure people into using their card for purchases. This is TWO WEEKS where people who don't understand the rules make purchases at a 24 % rate. It's even possible that the balance transfer might exceed their credit line when it is posted/processed if they've used their card during this two weeks. After the balance transfer is complete, they can not begin to pay off the balance transfer until they pay the balance for the purchases made earlier. This increases the likelihood that their balance will lapse into the non-promotional rate. This is predatory, manipulative, and deceitful. THERE SHOULD BE A LAW PROHIBITING THIS TWO WEEK DELAY. It's obviously an intentional way to take advantage of financially unaware or desperate people and lure them into using their card.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I have communicated with XXXX XXXX over the years, and have provided them with proof of the Chapter XXXX discharge paperwork on several occasions. The debt owed to XXXX XXXX was discharged in XX/XX/XXXX in a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy under XXXX XXXX. It was timeshare that was paid off but they continue charging fees. I have not heard from them in over 10 years. Today, I received a harassing call from Sunrise Credit Services, # XXXX, on behalf of monies owed to XXXX XXXX. I informed the agent it was discharged in XX/XX/XXXX in a Chapter XXXX. She demanded the information ; however, I had to call back since I was driving. I called Sunrise Credit Services back the same day and XXXX XXXX answered. I explained it was discharged in a Chapter XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX but before I could provide the case number she states : It doesn't matter why we are calling, you paid on this back in XX/XX/XXXX. Before I could provide the Bankruptcy Case number : XXXX filed in XXXX, GA she yells : \" Call back with a better attitude '' then hangs the phone up in my face. Upon calling back I spoke to XXXX XXXX again. She stated that since I filed in XX/XX/XXXX and made a payment in XX/XX/XXXX they did not need the bankruptcy information because the monies were still owed. I explained that I was not aware of a payment in XX/XX/XXXX and asked how much. She would not provide me with the information, but stated that the {$6000.00} will not go away. She hung up again. I am being harassed by this company, and specifically by employee XXXX XXXX who refused to take down any information with regards to the Chapter XXXX filing and discharge in XX/XX/XXXX.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I have placed a security freeze on my credit report account at Experian in XX/XX/2017, for a {$10.00} fee. I am now trying to temporarily remove this freeze again but Experian 's website is not allowing me to do this, despite that : - all my entered information is correct - there never has been any fraud, theft or other issues on my credit report/info - I provided the correct PIN number that was specifically created for the freeze - the identical information provided was good enough to procure a free credit report on XX/XX/XXXX The website reports that it can not verify my identity and that I have to mail in copies driver license, proof of residency, and SS #. This is a ridiculous and onerous request. Sending all this information by paper mail is unsafe. The request is especially ridiculous since I myself have initiated the freeze and have the correct PIN. If setting up a freeze online is possible, it must be possible to also unfreeze this account online. I have recently moved but my new address is a previous place of residence. All my former and current addresses are already known to Experian, as recent free credit reports show. If identity can be verified online for a free credit report, why all of sudden would my identity be not verifiable when it comes to a security freeze? I should also state that I only initiated the freeze due to the infamous hacker incident of client data in XX/XX/2017. I find Experian 's handling of this issue unprofessional and exceedingly burdensome ; this is the reason for my complaint.\n",

Now, while Wells Fargo has reduced the \" principal '' account balance by {$19000.00}, they've never adjusted the balance for the EXCESS \" interest '' paid and CONTINUE to pay, in having a higher and incorrect account balance of {$41000.00} approximately. The correct balance as of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), is {$27000.00}, with a daily periodic interest rate of {$2.00}.

      "VALUE OF S is This complaint is in response to Citi, their usage of programs including Payment Safeguard, and the refusal to refund fees taken from me, the continued use of the program, the unethical responses that show conflicts and changes to their story, and overall predatory practices. The simplest breakdown of my complaint is the following. After numerous requests regarding refunds via Citi and Payment Safeguard they have declined. However, through the course of these requests through phone calls, and the CFPB Citi has shown holes in their story, exposed themselves to inaccuracy, and has either lied or acted unethically. Citi claimed initially that I signed up for a program called payment safeguard over the phone in XXXX. Via their letter they say that there are not phone records of this due to time and I further express that I never signed up for it. That in and of itself should be grounds for refund based off of their XXXX fine and ordered payback. Then in a second letter where they declined refund they admit that I never signed up for Payment Safeguard in that the program I supposedly signed up for ( which I still maintain I did not ) underwent a name change that was not communicated to customers. This also should demonstrate that I should be allowed refund in that my story truly does show I never signed up for a Payment Safeguard. Further discrepancies arise between the two letters when looking at the mailed statements they claim to have sent, and emailed statements. The first letter says two letters were mailed about ending Payment Safeguard in XXXX and they attempt to say there were never undeliverable but fail to address that undeliverable should not warrant an argument in that no letter would be mailed back to them unless it was certified mail. Further, they discuss emails and undeliverable without addressing how something from Payment Safeguard would likely go to an email as spam because of the predatory nature and inability to be found online. Thus they did not communicate effectively the name change, the predatory nature, or the issues with this fee that appeared on statements. As to their claim that they mailed monthly statements that addressed how to cancel Payment Safeguard that is simply untrue. As per the attachment there is no information regarding what Payment Safeguard is, what it does, or why enrolled. Per the attached statements it is clear that there is only a phone number with zero explanation or information. In fact the phone number listed is one of 5 listed on a statement. Simply put, Payment Safeguard is listed as a fee and is predatory. Finally, in the documents on the CFPB website it clearly states that Payment Safeguard enrolled clients of Citi would not need to do anything to receive a refund which is contrary to the information from the most recent Citi letter. Nowhere in the CFPB documents does it state a timeline, a due date, or a timeframe in order to receive a refund. This is all the more difficult when an individual did not sign up for a program, was unaware they were enrolled, and did not know how to end fees that amounted to thousands of dollars. Especially when Citi changed program names, was held culpable and fined by the CFPB, and took advantage of consumers. Citi took advantage of consumers, paid refunds to some, and is attempting to get out of refunding my account over contradictory information that is misleading and frankly flies in the face of the information the CFPB has given out. A full refund should be granted for any and all fees taken from my account on behalf of Citi and the supposed Payment Safeguard. The fact that they still work with this predatory arm is shameful and misleading. As a customer of Citi for XXXX years I am appalled to be so taken advantage of by an arm of the company that can not even be contacted by phone. Finally, if they can not prove I enrolled, that alone should be grounds based off of the CFPB payout. Below, is my previous complaint which also expresses dates, holes in the Citi framework, plan, and customer handling experience. In XXXX of XXXX during a conversation I was made aware of an issue with Citi due to something called Payment Safeguard. After doing some digging I realized that I was enrolled in this program and tried to find out what it was. Unfortunately there is no tie to Payment Safeguard anywhere on the Citi website, and as the attachments show there is not a Payment Safeguard website that exists. I was able to track down a phone number via a statement and called to find out what the program is. I was then told of services and a plan that I never enrolled in. I instantly cancelled my enrollment because I was unaware I was a part of it and slowly came to the realization that Citi and Payment Safeguard had taken thousands of dollars from me over the course of years. I went back through old statements and looked on in horror to see that this payment safeguard is simply listed as a fee and not an extra service, nor something I enrolled in. It is on the second page and looks like a charge and nothing else. Without knowledge of being enrolled in the program it is impossible to know what it is and it only looks like the cost of doing business with Citi. After finding out about this program that I was enrolled in without my knowledge I did more research only to find that the CFPB fined city XXXX XXXX dollars and ordered them to pay back XXXX XXXX to duped customers which I was one of. However, I never received a refund, nor any communication from city in or around XXXX when this refund took place. Nor did Citi send out any information when they were fined in XXXX to individuals enrolled in Payment Safeguard what had happened with the fine, what the program was, why they were in the wrong, or what to expect regarding refunds. Aside from newspaper stories and what was published by the CFPB it appears they swept things under the rug. At the end of XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to numerous Citi customer service reps and was told repeatedly that they could not give me any information on Payment Safeguard because it is a separate department and could only show that there was a case that I requested pending. Further, I called Payment Safeguard numerous times and all they could say was that a request was sent for review to some department in Citi that was impossible to transfer me to. I repeatedly said that I never enrolled in this program, wanted my money back, and was frequently passed around. In one instance when I called the payment safeguard number it redirected me to a service that tried to sell me services as opposed to any customer service. In XXXX of XXXX I received a letter from Citi saying that I enrolled in this program in XXXX and that because I was covered by the program I could not receive a refund. I immediately inquired for a new review because a. ) I never signed up, b. ) they issued refund for their practice with this company ( something I should qualify for ) c. ) was never notified of the program, details, supposed benefits d. ) was not notified of they refunds, payouts, or the issues involved. I received another letter saying the same thing, that I signed up in XXXX and would not receive a refund. I then set up a complaint with the CFPB regarding some of the information that I stated clearly above, and my need for a refund for any and all fees paid to Payment Safeguard based off of Citi 's deceptive practice for which they were fined. Yesterday, I received notice from Citi that I will not receive a refund based off of weak and deceptive claims that do not answer the questions answered. As I have always said I did not enroll in the program. Citi claims that I did over the phone in XXXX but does not have any record to prove this as they clearly mention in the letter attached. This alone, along with their fine and fee should be grounds for a refund. They were proved deceptive, can not prove I signed up which I state I did not, and should thus refund all fees from XXXX XXXX. Second, they state that there were communications sent in XXXX, one via email and one via mail. These communications were never received, nor can Citi prove they were delivered. Their letter states that they did not receive notice that they were \" undeliverable '' but only certified mail would be returned to the sender and a letter from Citi would not have met this criteria. Thus, to use that as legal standing is once again deceptive and simply incorrect. Finally, as the letter states the fees are listed on the statement which is true but also not clear nor understandable. There are numerous numbers, fees, lines of interest, etc. on every statement. As an individual that did not sign up, did not know of the program, and without any knowledge of it there is no way to know it was an add on. It is only listed as a fee and does not state it is with a separate company or outside entity. All of these reasons clearly show the pattern that Citi engaged in and has continued to even though they were fined and were forced to submit refunds. These continued practices along with no proof of communicating to me the consumer, nor proof of my enrollment qualify for a refund and should have happened in XXXX. Marrying this with their lack of communication of the program, what it entails, or that Citi was found liable for their practices further shows that there should be a refund. The letter Citi sent is flawed, makes blanket generalizations, carries no proof of good faith operation, nor consumer conscience. It only shows a weak attempt to skirt the issue and not address what should have been made right in XXXX via refund. Further, the communication they claim they sent in XXXX does not do anything and should not mean anything considering the company was found liable in XXXX. Citi was cited for deceptive practice and supposed communication that can not be proved is not grounds worth standing on in light of the finding by the CFPB. A full refund should be issued immediately.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is In XX/XX/2018 We purchased counter tops from XXXX XXXX with our USAA checking account in the amount of {$980.00}. When we received the counters they were severely damaged by one of the workers with their forklift. The countertops had to be reordered resulting in us having to pay our contractors extra for canceling and rescheduling the job of install. When they finally got the new counters to us we realized that the counters were in horrible shape. They were cracked, and warped. We contacted XXXX XXXX back and wanted to return them as they were in horrible shape. XXXX refused to do any type of refund. They told us they do not warranty them and will not return them. The installing contractor had to spend several hours trying to repair them. We contacted our bank USAA hoping that they would protect their members and help us recover our losses. USAA gave us a provisional credit for the counters but after \" investigating '' ( which they didnt do ) they took the credit back. Said that they were siding with XXXX XXXX. Now they have closed our checking account with a negative balance because we had to pay that money to the contractor for new counters.

On XX/XX/XXXX, at the time of signing- the Notary placed NEW \" Final Disclosure '' on top of our Loan Documents changing the terms of the XX/XX/XXXX \" Final Disclosure '' and forcing our hand in accepting the inclusion of escrowed insurance and tax payments. According to CFPB, it's against the law to give this less than 3 days notice before signing. We were coerced and this will negatively affect our finances moving forward, putting us at higher risk while also causing us to lose the benefit of controlling our own monies and using our credit to our best interest. USAA could not give any clear answers as to why they did this at the last minute as we were in the process for almost 2 months, nor would they offer any reconciliation. USAA then spent our valuable time having us continue to email and call them to re-hash the scenario to different representatives, also putting us on hold at 20-30 minute increments and eventually offered \" hope '' that the servicer could adjust off the escrow. When we asked if having escrow taken off has ever happened, they said \" No. '' We will lose the ability to make interest on the monthly payments to escrow and we will lose the ability to pay-down the principal during the year because of USAA 's incompetence with this matter.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a dispute about a bankruptcy showing up on my credit report inaccurately. I got a letter back from XXXX and Transunion on XX/XX/XXXX saying that it was verified as accurate from XXXX. I find this hard to believe as the only person who can legally verify this item would be the person or instution with first hand knowledge in this case the bankruptcy court itself. I have documentation from the court house saying they do not verify records with any 3rd parties or credit bureaus. ( see attached letter ) Not only that under the FCRA 603 ( o ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ( i ; iii ) concerning 3rd parties or anyone pertaining to this particular situation I would have to give written consent and permission for them to report this on my credit file.. I have not consented to anyone posting this subterfuge. Not only is this information inaccurately reporting.. It is ILLEGALLY reporting. So I disputed with the credit bureaus again on XX/XX/XXXX exercising my rights under the FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 7 ) to request a complete description of all methods used to investigate and verify this item. They have not respond and it has now been over 45 days. According to the FCRA in order for Credit Bureaus to report information on my file it MUST be 100 % Accurate and True. This inaccurate bankruptcy showing up on my credit report has caused me pain and suffering and has prevented me from obtaining credit to make a living for my family. I demand direct proof of the accuracy of this Account according to FCRA, Section 611, paragraph ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) or delete the bankruptcy from my credit report according to FCRA, Section 609 a ( 2 ). Thank you.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is To Whom It May Concern Hello. I received a legal summons on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX and am writing a letter to request help as I really do not know what to do and I can not afford to pay for a lawyer. In addition, I feel that I am being unfairly sued. According to XXXX XXXX I, XXXX ( as assignee of Citibank ), I owe the creditor {$1300.00}. I feel that this so-called \" debt '' is being requested in an unrighteous manner, and after doing a bit of research online, I seek to formally deny this complaint based upon the following reasons : 1. Statute of Limitations for California : Too much time has passed from the time that this money was credited thus the creditor has no right to the money anymore. According to California law, there is a statute of limitations of four years for all debts except those made with oral contracts. This means that for unsecured common debts like credit card debt, lenders can not attempt to collect debts that are more than four years past due. I have saved files from Citibank that go back as far as XXXX and the very last payment that I have records of according to my bank statement was made in XXXX of XXXX for {$2800.00}. Thus, I no longer owe this creditor any money. 2. The debt has been sold to too many collection agencies thus I no longer owe this money to Citibank that was the original creditor with which I entered into a contract several years ago. I have a general habit of saving all my paperwork over several years and the information that I found is as follows : I received the first letter from collection agency, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX a collection agency in XXXX, Ohio on XX/XX/XXXX offering a debt settlement. I then received a second letter from a different collection agency, XXXX XXXX I, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that they were now the creditor for the account and that I owed XXXX.. Next, the third letter I received was again from XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX , offering a settlement of {$570.00}. ( This by the way seems unlawful to me because there were two collection agencies that Citibank apparently had sold the debt to requesting different amounts of money ). Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a fourth letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, IL expressing an outstanding account with their organization and that they were willing to accept {$420.00} in one payment. I then received a fifth letter on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX informing me that I owed a debt of {$1300.00}. The next letter ( the sixth ) I received again from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX showing that I had an outstanding Citi Mastercard account with various payment options. The seventh letter I received was from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, CA offering various settlements for the balance of {$1100.00}. I received an eighth letter on XX/XX/XXXX again from XXXX XXXX XXXX asking for total due of {$1300.00}. Lastly, I received a ninth letter on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX also requesting a payment. This original debt has just been in the hands of too many collection agencies and I do not believe that I owe Citibank any longer especially since the credit limit of the original account was {$1100.00} and although I made regular payments several years ago, the full balance that is being unfairly requested is over {$1300.00}. It just does not make sense. 3. I made a good faith attempt to pay the apparent debt / balance on several occasions. For instance, when I originally opened an account with Citibank in XXXX, I made regular payments in a timely manner. More recently, XXXX XXXX XXXX requested money from me and without questioning the matter, I just gave them the bank information they requested, planning to make regular small payments ( which I really could not afford as it would cause me hardship due to my XXXX and lack of income ). However, I received a letter from this institution informing me that the wrong account information was given to them and that they could no longer accept any check payments from me. I immediately called this company back to resolve the issue. I had in fact given them the correct account information ( perhaps it was missing three XXXX in the beginning ) but my account number was correct as that is the one I always use when I access funds with my local bank XXXX XXXX XXXX. Yet, although I explained the simple error and nicely asked if they could work with me and still accept monthly payments via check, they refused to offer me another chance to conveniently pay with my checks and only would accept money orders or cashier 's checks. It was really surprising to me since I was cooperating with them and was willing to pay this balance that they claimed I owed. 4. I am a XXXX and unemployed graduate student whose sole source of income has been from the Social Security Administration ( Disability ) and educational loans & grants for the past several years. I can not afford to pay this amount of money as it would put me at a serious disadvantage financially to a point where my health and well-being will be at great stake. When I made larger sum payments to Citibank several years ago ( for {$2800.00} - the most recent payment which was in XXXX of XXXX ), I was actually using money I received from student loans. I just could not do this anymore so I allowed my credit cards to all charge off. 5. Misrepresentations about the debt ( including the amount owed ) : I originally entered into a contract with Citibank and since they sold my debt to several other creditors, I no longer owe Citibank any money. I have a copy of the application approval letter that I originally received from Citibank, dated back to XXXX. I let the cards charge off sometime in XXXX and it is now almost XXXX. 6. Unauthorized withdrawals to my checking account : A company ( I'm not sure which one specifically ) kept withdrawing money from my bank account on a monthly basis ( I think it was {$36.00} ) without my authorization. Moreover, the e-check that was fraudulently written by me had no corresponding name associated with it so I had no idea whom to contact to dispute this. I filed a complaint with my bank and finally this company ( whichever one it was ) was unable to withdraw money from my account any longer. The summons claims that my last payment to \" the creditor '' was on XX/XX/XXXX. However, I obtained a copy of my bank statement from that month and there was no name \" Citibank '' on any of the checks that were withdrawn. There was a mysterious charge of {$36.00} ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) from which company of which I am not aware. But in terms of an AUTHORIZED withdrawal from my checking account, the last that I have record of with the corresponding name \" Citibank '' was ( again ) back in XXXX of XXXX. I have copies of my bank statement to prove this. I genuinely need help with this lawsuit as I am unfortunately very foreign to this whole process ( Ive never been sued before ). I have records showing regular payments that were made to Citibank several years ago. They were also consistent and timely. I unfortunately had to let most of my credit cards charge off because I was drowning in debt and being someone who has a variety of medical issues including medical expenses, this is a very scary reality. I really would rather not file bankruptcy over something around the price of {$1000.00}. It just does not seem logical to me. I sincerely hope that someone will be able to assist me with this legal matter involving debts or balances that I believe I no longer owe. Thank you kindly for your time. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX\n",

I contacted them after speaking with the bank representative to resolve the issue by asking if I can settle out with them by giving them {$50.00} and they refused that offer and requested for more information and after that conversation I told them I would get an attorney and they told me to do this. Since the bank I bank with is a third party to parties that are trying to collect the debt, they are waiting on me to send them a letter and proof of this debt being fraudulent. I am sending my evidence to resolve this issue.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I have requested now 3 times with Citibank to change my billing due date to the beginning of the month. I was told it takes 2 to 3 billing cycles to take effect. I made my payments well before the cited due date on each bill around the 5th of every month. After a few months and no due date change I contacted Citibank a second time and was told there was no note on my account that I had requested it. So they again told me the same thing that it would take 2 to 3 billing cycles to take effect and cancelled only one of the late fees they charged me, this was in XX/XX/XXXX. I called again today XX/XX/XXXX. Again was told the same thing there was no notation on my account for such a request and I had been charged a late fee ranging from {$27.00} to {$38.00} every month since XXXX ( that was as far back as they could see due to archiving ). When I spoke to a manager ( XXXX ) she was said there was not a note at first, then somehow found a note on my account from my call in XXXX. She stated the note indicated that I requested a due date change but they were unable to do it due to terms being changed at that time. I was NOT told this by the person I spoke to in XXXX. I have been charged a late fee every month for the last year because they failed to comply with my request to change my due date and failed to notify me that they were unable to do it. I have made a payment every month some doubled up because of the bills I received with different amounts due. I was again told that she could not change the due date for my account. I find this incredibly hard to believe that in this day of technology they can't change a simple due date for an account. She also stated she was not authorized to waive more than one late fee per year. This seems like a simple request that has been ignored now three times, and a failure to properly note my account when I call their customer service center. In the interest of complete transparency there are XXXXwo instances where I made two payments in one month ( on separate dates ) to try and follow their sloppy billing notices so I understand the late fees there although it still was NOT my fault they failed to change the due date/billing cycle. I was told I can call back in XXXX to request it again. It's simply ridiculous.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is On XXXX XXXX, 2019, I asked my bank ( XXXX XXXX ) to obtain a credit report as part of an application for a mortgage loan. Three companies reported : Experian, XXXX, and XXXX. Both Experian and XXXX referenced several Creditor accounts that were incorrect, that is, the Creditor information was not mine but actually belonged to another person. XXXX information was mostly correct. I contacted XXXX to dispute the incorrect information. After two calls, a XXXX representative took my complaint and initiated the steps to remove the incorrect information. I was not successful in contacting Experian either by internet or phone call to rectify the report. I have three fundamental concerns : ( 1 ) how and why was incorrect information added to my identity, ( 2 ) why are credit-rating companies like Experian and XXXX permitted access to my personal financial information and have such incompetence in ensuring that the information is correct, ( 3 ) why do financial institutions like XXXX XXXX rely on credit-rating reports when the reports may have inaccuracies? It seems that persons like me are the ones who have to rectify credit-rating problems created by the incompetence of companies like Experian and XXXX. My suspicion regarding concern ( 1 ) is that the credit-rating companies are not using a complete set of personal information when they obtain financial information : namely, complete 9-digit social security numbers, current addresses, and birth dates, all correlated to an account held by a person. The incompetence of companies like Experian and XXXX places a terrible burden of proof on the financial status of US citizens. Why are such companies not appropriately regulated by the Federal Government?\n",

Upon receiving and reviewing these reports I found numerous fraudulent accounts had been established in my name in fraud, by someone who used my personal information. I began the dispute process immediately by both contacting the credit bureaus and creditors where the fraud accounts originated from. I wrote each bureau ( XXXX, Experian, XXXX ) very detailed letters and supplied them with proof ( Police Reports, Photo ID, ID Theft Reports ) I asked them to supply me with proof they they had on these debts/fraud accts, etc. Proof I asked them for was signed contracts of these accounts, IP addresses, physical mailing addresses, logins, bank accounts associates with these debts0 They have refused to supply me with this information and still reporting these fraudulent accounts because the creditors allegedy verified with them ( baiscally the creditors is paying them to report this fraudulent information )\n",
      "VALUE OF S is my vehicle was repossessed spring of 2017 on a Thursday evening around XXXX I was headed to a late evening meeting and the repo truck meet me behind the vehicle they were taking. I began to get my things out of the car and they began to get very aggressive both verbally and physically. I put my key into the ignition so that I could put the car in neutral for them. As I put the key in the ignition the repo truck operator grabbed my hand and yelled at his partner \" I got him key get the key get the key ''. as he squeezed my hand and snatched the key out of my hand. This was a breach of peace. in regards to the debt owed I never received a letter stating my debt I moved from my old apartment. the only way I found out about this debt is because I was contacted by my grandmother who lives in XXXX Ohio and she said that I was being sued I drove to XXXX to take care of it however im not sure how they even obtained her address but I live in Indiana the entire time even when the loan was originated but they're suing me in Ohio for a unverified amount of money that I was not even aware that I had the right to dispute. I contacted Automotive credit Corporation about the debt owed and they said that they would not discussed the debt any further unless they speak to an attorney.\n",

The disregard for follow through and/or auditing of this notification/message that was placed onto my credit report without clearly articulating the steps that an entity and/or company can take to contact me and the phone number of reference has caused me a missed financial mitigation opportunity and I want this resolved at once. Either Experian can remove this fraud notification from my report and/or can correct their error and contact the last three entity/companies whereby they have caused an application to cancel due to their error. I have called only to be routed to \" write them ''. I have written them with no follow-up.

Unless you plan to Investigate this account here is what I'm going to need from you is a payment history dating back on XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX But I'm asking you to delete this ASAP as you have wasted my time sending letters via US MAIL AND VIA the CFPB claiming to have verified this account And most of all you haven't investigated anything so please remove this account ASAP\n",
      "VALUE OF S is XXXX XXXX promised to report payments to credit bureau. However, XXXX XXXX did not begin reporting payment information to credit bureau until payment was seriously delinquent. As a result, i was not able to secure a refinance loan with another company to pay off this high interest debt. It is believed that XXXX XXXX had no intent to report on time payments to the credit bureau which is a violation of the fair credit reporting act which states that if a company reports information to a credit bureau the information should be fair and accurate. By not reporting on time payments, i believed that no payments would report to credit bureau and decided to save myself XXXX dollars by allowing the account to accelerate. Not only has XXXX XXXX reported delinquent payments but after not reporting payments at all, XXXX XXXX has back dated delinquent payments. The first payment reported by XXXX XXXX was reported in XXXX and it was reported as missing 5 payments. At that time, XXXX XXXX did not report on time payments. After disputing the information with experian, XXXX XXXX reported two on time payments ; a violation of the fair credit reporting act that states that if a business does not report accurate information, the information has to be removed from the credit report ; instead they made a correction. Also the reporting of information remains inaccurate aside from the reporting of on time payments. XXXX XXXX is reporting missed payments as biweekly payments, but they reported on time payments as monthly payments. A total of 5 payments were made on time before i began purposely missing payments. For example, XXXX XXXX reported 8 missed payments. The on time payments are only noticed by the monthly bar that shows whether a payment was made for the month. XXXX XXXX also violated the truth in lending act where the initial reports did not include amortization. It was told to me that the account could be paid in full and only pay the interest incurred at that time. When i tried to initiate pay off online, it stated that i needed to call in to pay off loan. At that time my payoff amount included interest of about 300 dollars. When i called in a rep stated that the pay off amount would include interest over the life of the loan. My borrowed amount was XXXX dollars, after making two payments, i was told that my payoff amount would be around 8000 for XX/XX/XXXX and would increase thereafter. At the time, there was no amortization schedule. The day after, i checked online an the company had included the schedule. Had this information been present when i began the loan, i would have returned the funds. Furthermore, this amount was ridiculous as if i allowed it to accelerate in XXXX, the amount would only be XXXX. In addition, XXXX XXXX presents this loan as a personal loan but infact it is a high interest installment loan. And should be subject to the laws of a high interest payday loan. Just as those loans due to the nature of how they are paid and the overbearing interest can not be reported to major credit bureaus, this loan should not. There is a reason behind the non reporting of on time payments to credit bureaus. XXXX XXXX had no intent to report on time payments. However, they wanted to be able to report in the case that the loan became delinquent. Big businesses can not exploit and misuse an misinform the public regarding loans. It was impossible to pay this loan off due to the negligence of the company in providing true, fair, and accurate information to myself and the credit bureaus. For the reasons presented here, i would like to file a complaint against XXXX XXXX for violating the fair credit reporting act and the truth in lending act ; and ask that this account be completely removed from my credit report including all late payments reported.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) acquired my mortgage including servicing beginning on or about XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage was previously originated and serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. At origination and at the time of the acquisition/servicing transfer to SLS, the loan was only escrowed for property taxes. It was not for insurance as the condominium master policies were provided at origination and were sufficient for closing. It is extremely important to note that my loan was originated without a requirement or condition for me to have an HO-6 insurance policy. On XX/XX/XXXX SLS claims to have sent me a first notice of expiration of a condominium unit owners policy. I never received the first notice from SLS. On XX/XX/XXXX SLS sent me a second notice which I did receive. Shortly thereafter I called and verbally spoke to SLS loan servicing department to inform them that my loan was originated without an HO-6 policy and that it was not required at origination. SLS was only able to respond that the HO-6 policy was required by law in Florida. I informed them that it was required in Florida in XXXX but an amendment was made to the Florida laws in XXXX in which the requirement was removed. The SLS representative did not take the time to consider the correct information I relayed to her and just kept saying that HO-6 insurance was required in Florida. I then called a second time to see if I could speak to a rationale person at SLS and again communicated to SLS that it erroneously was requiring me to have an HO-6 insurance policy. Again I explained to the representative that Florida laws were amended in XXXX and that any explicit requirement that condominiums must have an HO-6 policy was removed. Since the SLS representative continued to communicate to me that Florida law requires me to have an HO-6 policy, I specifically asked the representative to have SLS Legal send me evidence that Florida had such a requirement. The representative stated that someone would research and call me back. On XX/XX/XXXX a SLS representative named XXXX XXXX ( spelling may be wrong ) left me a voicemail requiring me again to have an HO-6 policy and to send evidence of an HO-6 policy. She also stated that it was Required by the State of Florida which is not correct. I have this voicemail saved as evidence that SLS gave me incorrect and misleading information. Although I requested it, SLS never provided me in writing any legal citation that I was required in the state of Florida to maintain an HO-6 insurance policy. On XX/XX/XXXX SLS force placed insurance costing {$5100.00} covering XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. This amount of force placed insurance impacted my monthly loan payment. My loan payment increased {$1200.00} ( 77 % ) from {$1600.00} to {$2900.00} based on an escrow analysis completed by SLS which was immediately enforced. Even though I did not have any prior damage to my property or any claims, they placed insurance retroactively for the entire year at an egregious cost of {$5100.00} when the market cost of HO-6 policies is approximately $ 600- {$700.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX SLS then renewed the forced placed HO-6 policy at an even higher cost of {$5600.00}. This new policy is a whopping 10 % higher than the prior policy which was force placed just 2 months prior. I ended up getting my own HO-6 policy for the sole purpose of reducing my required escrow amount and monthly payment to escrow until this issue was resolved and NOT because of any Florida requirement because one does not exist. My cost of getting an HO-6 policy was {$590.00}, approximately 89 % less than what SLS charged my escrow account. In the end, I believe the actions of SLS violate the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which requires covered persons or service providers such as SLS to refrain from committing unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. SLS force placed an HO-6 insurance policy on my loan on the premise that it was required by Florida law as SLS representatives stated in a voicemail message which I saved and can provide. The citation of that law could not be provided by SLS when requested. Therefore it is contended that no such legal requirement exists for my loan. In addition, no such requirement was in place at the time of my loan origination and, therefore, no such requirement can arbitrarily be imposed on my loan by SLS at its leisure. As such, the act of SLS of incorrectly force placing an HO-6 insurance policy on my loan was an UNFAIR act in that 1 ) it caused me direct and substantial injury since my monthly payment immediately increase by {$1200.00} ( 77 % ) per month and I had to eventually get my own HO-6 policy which I was not required to obtain 2 ) it was not avoidable by me ; even though I attempted to resolve the matter with SLS prior to the force placement, SLS did not act appropriately and continued with the erroneous force placement ; furthermore, if I did not pay the increased escrow amount, then SLS would have reported negatively and incorrectly to the credit bureaus which would have created yet another regulatory violation ( of FCRA ) on their behalf 3 ) my financial injury was in no way outweigh by any benefit of having the HO-6 policy ; in fact, the first policy was retroactive 11 months from the date it was purchased ; since I had no events or claims during those 11 months then the benefit of the policy was solely for SLS, NOT the customer ; in addition, since the HO-6 policy is not a legal requirement, then I do not believe the benefits of the policy costing approximately 89 % more than the typical market price outweigh its costs. The acts of SLS were also DECEPTIVE in that 1 ) I the consumer ( and potentially other consumers ) was mislead by SLS as an SLS personnel made an explicit Representation to me that the HO-6 policy was required by Florida law. I have subsequently consulted 2 separate law firms and both have informed me that Florida law was amended in XXXX and as a result there is no such explicit requirement that I have an HO-6 policy on my condominium ; furthermore, since I requested SLS to provide me evidence that a Florida requirement for the insurance existed and SLS did not provide evidence of such legal requirement, then SLS may have Omitted material information ; 2 ) since my loan was originated without the requirement of an HO-6 insurance policy and without the requirement to place funds in escrow for the purpose of purchasing an HO-6 policy, then my belief that an HO-6 policy was not required is reasonable 3 ) the misleading act by SLS is material The acts of SLS were also ABUSIVE in that I that consumer placed reasonable reliance on SLS to act in my interest. However, SLS did not adequately perform its responsibilities in understanding Florida law and did not provide me with the evidence and citation of the Florida law SLS referred to in its voicemail probably because the requirement does not exist ; SLS was in a position to take advantage of me as I felt I did not have any other avenue to gain clarity on the matter and resolve it except for getting my own legal advice. Should this formal complaint not be resolved to a mutual satisfaction, I will have no choice but to proceed with formal legal action. I hope we can all come to an agreement.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL.

      "VALUE OF S is I have a negative thing on my credit report that I never knew about. It was from Bank of America. Its appearing as a charge off of XXXX $ and I never received any notices of needing to pay this. It says the last time I paid this was XX/XX/2017. I didnt know about this and I wouldve paid it if I ever received a notice. Please send me a bill and remove from my credit report.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My complaint 's are in regards to my former mortgage company Bank of America. I qualified for a \" settlement award '' due to \" deficient mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes. '' And because of Bank of America 's \" deficient mortgage servicing '' my principal balance is substantially higher. A monthly statement dated XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of America states my principal balance was {$160000.00}. A statement dated XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of America states the principal balance was {$200000.00}. A monthly statement from my current mortgage company dated XX/XX/XXXX states my principal balance is {$190000.00}. My current mortgage company is requesting a document stating that this was not supposed to happen so they may review it and possibly reduce my principal balance. My current mortgage company is reviewing my loan, to see if I qualify for a loan modification. Being that the principal balance is so high my payments are high. My house is only worth approximately {$150000.00} Also, Bank of America reported me to the credit bureau every month that I did not make a payment over the course of 6 years, after I was firmly instructed by a negotiator from Bank of America \" DO NOT make a payment while your loan is under review for a loan modification. If you send us a payment we will send it back to you. '' However, in an attempt to move things along with the loan modification process I mailed a certified check for {$9000.00}. When I called several times to check status on payment and spoke with several different representative 's no one could locate the check. However, after I hired an attorney and went to court the {$9000.00} surprisingly all of a sudden the check appeared. I spent {$5000.00} on an attorney to save my home and to move along the loan modification process. I Never should 've had to hire an attorney to get Bank of America to complete a review, that should take no more than 30 days. BUT after 2 years of them reviewing my loan I had NO choice. And even after hiring an attorney it took another 4 YEARS! The amount I received from the settlement was {$870.00}, that will NEVER justify all of the stress, mental anguish, loss of a job I loved, {$5000.00} for an attorney, having my life and my little boys life on hold for 6 years, my little boy and I living out of boxes nothing on ANY of the walls not even my little boys room, because of sheriff sale dates set and cancelled over and over. Six Christmas ' in a row I had to explain to my son why we were n't decorating outside and putting up ALL of the decorations, especially his village and Santa collection. Christmas is his Favorite holiday. It was like we were prisoner 's in our own home. Christmas is a difficult time for us being that my husband, his daddy XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Not being able to decorate for 6 years at Christmas ' made it that much more difficult. Ironically when I watched 2 Christmas Classic movies the Scrooge and the Grinch I could n't help but to have Bank of America on my mind throughout the entire movie. I do n't mean that in a sarcastic manner, in a serious manner we watch all of the Christmas classics and those 2 movies were very, very sad to watch if you can picture my little boy and I in our living room with just a Christmas tree all lit up, absolutely nothing on the walls and cardboard boxes scattered. Was very depressing for me. It was sad to think in all reality Bank of America was Scrooge and was the Grinch in real life, our lives. {$870.00} from the settlement will NEVER justify the 6 years Bank of America took from us, Especially 6 years from a little boy, his Christmas decorations, having all of his favorite things on his walls and his room, for 6 years he got his clothes out of boxes, Never out of a dresser, 6 years Never had play dates at our house. While Bank of America was providing \" deficient mortgage servicing '' NEVER did they stop to think OR even CARE about their homeowner 's that EVERY SINGLE ON OF US has a story, and how this affected us, our families, babies and children and NEW babies being brought home. Now Bank of America will know mine and my son 's personal story. And, how they, Bank of \" AMERICA '' made my little boy and I feel like their prisoner 's and our \" home '' a prison for 6 YEARS! That 's NOT AMERICA! Or by ANY MEANS living the AMERICAN DREAM!\n",

Please block these account, note that there might some accounts that a not showing in my credit yet. I'm currently receiving collection mail from different place, I will report them as they come. I have follow the steps and filed an FTC complaint that is attach to this report as well as my ID and SS. Thank you.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My issue with Bank of America started XX/XX/XXXX. I have had a surplus of fraudulent activity occur with all of my accounts at Bank of America including personal checking accounts, personal saving accounts, custodial accounts, investment account. The perpetrators have done electronic transfers, electronic checks and bill pay. They have set up accounts in names, both individual and companies. They have made payments to companies directly from my accounts. I have taken precautionary measures that have been recommended by Bank of America. These measures have included closing and opening accounts, changing online login and passcodes, adding security questions, adding safepass, getting a new cell phone and number, banking off of XXXX mobile device and getting a new mobile device, filing a police report and filing a report with the sheriff 's department. I have done all of the above more than 6 of 7 times. I have gone into Banking centers. I have been on calls for anywhere from 2 to 4 hours getting transferred from one department to the next with the explanation of that is not within the scope of their department ( although I had waited 30 minutes to even get someone on the phone for each department ). I have had most of my fraudulent withdrawals returned but what I am writing about is a transaction that occurred from my daughter 's custodial account in XXXX XXXX this transaction was one of many that occurred at the same time from different accounts. the amount of the withdrawal was {$2500.00}. Initially the amount was returned. I was notified that no additional action was needed on my part. The past few months I had to freeze ALL of my accounts. That account was already frozen after the above fraudulent activity occurred mid-XXXX. In having recurrent fraud I went back to scan all of my accounts, even the ones that were frozen and noticed by daughter 's balance was the {$2500.00} less than before. once I started investing I found and was then told that the funds had been taken back because I did not submit the required paperwork that has to be filled out within 60 days of the complaint. as mentioned above I had already been told no additional action was required at that time because they investigated and found the refund was appropriate. After finding out this new bit of information I asked next steps and I was told that it was resubmitted and I would have to wait until they heard back from the merchant, who is XXXX. I tried vehemently to explain that this was an error and to look at all the red flags on my account. They continued to regurgitate the policy so I waited. well I just received their response stating that after their research they state that the merchants received proof of my enrollment or documentation. This is completely false which is why I am admitting a formal complaint. Before receiving this letter I even wrote to corporate and did not receive one phone call, email or letter from corporate. I required a signature whenever the letter was received and someone did sign for it..again I have proof. I believe this may be internal. I have changed my online access so many times and have had instances where I would actually be talking to an agent and someone would be trying to log into my account real time. A few agents were baffled and was able to see that these logins were done from the same XXXX snf computer but could not see an IP address. I just want my daughter 's money back that we are saving for her college tuition and I plan on moving all of my accounts. This has been the only bank I have banked with and am so disappointed. I was hoping we could get these things resolved. I am a platinum member and was used to the bank so continued to try things their way to try to stop this activity. I have so many notes, documentation, names, dates that it is too much to scan and attach. but I can definitely provide all that when needed. I gave the XXXX County Sheriff 's department a sequence of events and they are investigating. A case number can be provided. I have a very descriptive email to the sherriff outlining the sequence of events including account numbers, names they used to open accounts, emails used, phone numbers attached and merchants/corporations they transferred money to. Dates with details listed included XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and it continued into XX/XX/XXXX. I just received an email 2 days ago about another attempt from an account that is frozen. although these accounts have been changed to new accounts. old accounts have been left open and frozen with negative balances so that activities my be tracked. all this being said to explain that it does not take a wise person to figure out that if all this has happened, the money taken from my daughter 's account is also fraudulent. it is not my fault that an agent told me that no further action was needed and bank of America 's excuse is that now they have to make a decision based off of the merchant. I have that letter attached. I can provide a plethora of documentation to support my complaint. I am a physician and the last thing I have time for is tracking my funds and being in constant communication with bank of America about my hard earned money that they just gave away to a criminal. they obviously do not have a secure system. it is definitely a inefficient system and too compartmentalized. I am disappointed.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is In early XXXX, I changed homeowners insurance companies to XXXX XXXX. Previously my homeowners insurance was through XXXX. Ditech paid XXXX XXXX for my new policy and directed me to sign and forward the refund check from XXXX to them. After the first check \" not arriving, '' XXXX reissued me another refund check in the amount of {$760.00} for the homeowners insurance payment that was made on XX/XX/2019. I resent the check with a tracking number this time and it miraculously was received by Ditech and deposited into my escrow account on XX/XX/19. In the meantime, Ditech had provided me my annual escrow analysis on XX/XX/19, which we knew would be inaccurate due to the change in insurance companies and the refund not being received/deposited before the escrow analysis was complete. Included in the refund check deposited on XX/XX/19 was a handwritten request for Ditech to rerun my annual escrow analysis now that the appropriate funds were back in my account. This never happened. I logged into my account a few days later to see the {$760.00} that was just refunded and deposited back into my escrow had been disbursed via check # XXXX on XX/XX/19. After many phone calls I was able to finally speak to someone in the insurance department who had no explanation why someone had disbursed these funds and to who they had been disbursed. A customer service rep told me it was disbursed to XXXX XXXX. At this point I informed him we wired XXXX XXXX {$690.00} on XX/XX/19 and asked him if it made sense to him to pay XXXX XXXX not only twice but two totally different amounts, to which he said it didn't make sense to him. I contacted XXXX XXXX at this point, which to date never received a check. With the help of the woman in the insurance dept at Ditech I had my \" stolen '' money ( {$760.00} that had been supposedly disbursed to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX via check # XXXX ) returned to my escrow account on XX/XX/19. I thought my problems would end there since I also indicated to them that my future escrow activity is inaccurate as it now shows the {$760.00} being my next distribution to XXXX XXXX rather than the {$690.00} that we actually paid and that that would need to be corrected and a new escrow analysis would need to be completed since the refund was not included in the initial analysis. I patiently waited a week before contacting Ditech customer service on XX/XX/19. To say the customer service rep was unhelpful would be too polite. He told me there was nothing he could do and that my account was still listed under review and it would be completed on XX/XX/19 ( over a week after my conversation with the woman from the insurance dept ). I asked to speak to a supervisor that was working on this previously with the insurance dept. To no surprise she wasn't in and he said he would leave her a message. I never received a call back. On XX/XX/19, a week later, I again contacted customer service because my escrow information is still not correct and a new escrow analysis has not been conducted. This gentleman tried to be helpful and tried to get my review expedited. He also informed me a request for a new analysis had never been submitted. While he seemed helpful, his hands were tied because he \" couldn't even reach his supervisors '' to try to get my review expedited or to get me someone to speak to. The best he could do is put me through to their voicemail. While this was only at XXXX yesterday, I still have not received a call back and am not optimistic to receive XXXX. I feel like I have gone above and beyond to get this corrected with XXXX help from Ditech, aside from getting my \" lost '' money replaced. My next payment due on XX/XX/2019 reflect a whole new payment based on this inaccurate escrow analysis. Ditech is now charging me {$100.00} more a month, which is in error. My escrow shortage was stated to be {$890.00} when in reality it should be closer to {$130.00}. They've given me the option to pay that shortage and have my monthly bill go up to {$820.00} or not pay the shortage and pay {$890.00}, which is the amount they are expecting from me on XX/XX/XXXX. I refuse to pay a shortage that is 8x what my actual shortage is and at this point I feel like I am going to be forced to pay a much higher monthly payment on XX/XX/XXXX because Ditech has failed to provide an accurate escrow analysis for over a month and a half. I have asked countless times now for a new analysis both in writing and verbally. I feel I have no choice now but to take my complaint to the CFPB as Ditech is clearly in violation of RESPA 1024.17.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Bank of America would not recognize my retiree status for the purpose of facilitating the free checking account offered in the Personal Schedule of Fees online for my Advantage Tiered Checking Account. I maintain that the waiver of monthly maintenance fee is a banking fee schedule, not a pension benefit. The Personal Schedule of Fees defines Employees and Retirees that are eligible for the waiver of the monthly maintenance fee as \" retirees with at least 10 years of vesting service, and age plus years of vesting service equal to at least 60 ''.

I left employment at age XXXX plus 24 years vested service is greater than XXXX. Bank of America acquired my banking deposits and credit accounts, our local ATMs and branches, and my vested pension obligation. The acquisition of XXXX Bank and the related subsidiaries gave Bank of America the opportunity to create new pricing, close branches and ATMs and set lending rates, certificate of deposit rates as they saw necessary. They put their name on it all, so I don't believe the Personal Schedule of Fees should be applied differently to retirees with the Bank of America - XXXX versus other Bank of America pensions. It is a banking fee schedule, not a pension plan. They declined my request because I was not age XXXX when I left employ of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that I was not in their employ in XXXX when they began providing waiver of fees to retirees of B of A.

      "VALUE OF S is I filed for bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. I have endured the penalties of a low FICO score for the past 10 years, including high interest rates, high insurance rates and impacts to employment. I was looking forward to having the bankruptcy finally removed from my credit report and having a high score and low interest rates, but my score has barely moved since the bankruptcy dropped off my credit report. Today, according to Transunion my score is XXXX. I contacted TransUnion via Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on XX/XX/XXXX, but TransUnion refused to take responsibility for the FICO score they are providing to lenders, saying it is the fault of the individual lenders. Therefore, I am including XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX in my complaint that TransUnion and XXXX, a credit reporting company of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, are artificially keeping my credit score low and continuing to punish me for my bankruptcy. ( Attached, please find snip 1 ) As mentioned earlier, there was no increase in points after the bankruptcy was dropped from the credit report. However, as shown in snip 2, Transunion and XXXX decreased my credit score by 36 points. Snip 3 shows the reason for the decrease in points is due to increase in debt. But as mentioned before, {$110000.00} is not due to personal loans, but to student loans, on a income driven repayment plan with XXXX. My monthly payment for this {$110000.00} is {$120.00}. The increase is debt is also not correct because it does not take payoffs into consideration. I took out a new car loan for {$13000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, after my 2016 XXXX XXXX was totaled in a car accident, which wasnt my fault. That means the loan for the XXXX was paid off, which is not included as a point increase. A debt consolidation loan taken out for {$7000.00} on XXXX that was completely paid off early on XX/XX/XXXX also was not shown as having positive points. There also seems to be some confusion about a car loan that I took out on XX/XX/XXXX. This loan was never actually funded. As you can see from the below clip, it was canceled the same day it was taken out. Therefore, this loan should not be a factor in my credit report score as shown by Snip 4 After submitting my complaint to TransUnion, I rechecked my XXXX account today, XX/XX/XXXX. It shows that my score increased by 2 points, because of debt reduction, but no other positive points, even though it shows that 3 recent inquires are no longer on my record, as shown by Snip 5 And somehow, since filing my complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score has now been dropped by 43 points, instead of 36 a week ago, as shown by Snip 6 How can a credit score drop by an additional 7 points when all I did was pay bills on time? ( Actually, Im not sure if the drop was by an additional 43 in a week. ) Perhaps the XXXX simulator can explain that. I used a XXXX tool called a simulator, in which you can enter different scenerios to see how it would impact my credit. Paying on time for 2 years, LOWERED my credit score by 14 points. Please see Snips 7 and 8. If paying on time lowers a persons credit score by 14 points, which is a positive thing, one must consider that XXXX and XXXX XXXX are artificially keeping my credit score low. As I stated in my previous complaint, over the past 10 years, I have had two late payments, which were due to a debt consolidation loan in XX/XX/XXXX. TransUnion, XXXX and XXXX XXXX do not consider having a good repayment history is a good thing.

I submitted enough information for you to carry out a reasonable investigation of my dispute, since you obviously did not investigate this account thoroughly enough the last time I submitted one.

They have stated when I have called them, that they have contacted your agency numerous times to have the other account removed to no avail, often noting unreasonable hold times to get through to the fraud department. If you had investigated properly, rather than use your XXXX system, you would have known, that not only have ever been late on this account, but that I am not the owner of this account, though your company claims to have verified this. It is at this time that I will point out that in XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Experian ), and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, et al, the courts ruled each and every time that the CRA couldn't merely \" parrot '' information from the creditors and collection agencies ... that they have to conduct an independent REASONABLE investigation to ensure the validity of the debt and the honesty/integrity of the creditor/XXXX in question.

      "VALUE OF S is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : My complaint is about a non-return of funds to my checking account ; an overdraft fee of {$35.00}, and an overdraft in the amount of {$24.00}, totaling {$58.00}. The problem that I am having is getting Wells Fargo to credit my account the {$35.00} overdraft fee, and the overdraft amount of {$24.00}, totaling {$58.00}. Prior to my going to my Wells Fargo branch to discuss this matter, the {$35.00} overdraft fee was posted ( visible ) on my online account ; but, for some strange reason, it is not showing ( visible ) on my online account today [ see attached ]. I hope Wells Fargo is not alleging that they never charged my account an overdraft fee. I find it extremely odd that the Wells Fargo 4-Page Account Statement has the {$35.00} overdraft fee on it ; where, my account statement does not [ see Wells Fargo 4-Page Account Statement ]. I have circled those transactions for your convenience. I can only speculate that the disparity in account statements would be intentionally misleading, deceptive, and an unethical business practice. Nevertheless, Wells Fargo should have credited my account in the amount of {$58.00} ; however you look at the situation. XXXX XXXX charged an unauthorized amount of {$310.00}, to my checking account, which caused my account to go into an overdraft status in the amount of {$24.00}. As a result of the {$24.00}, overdraft, Wells Fargo charged my account a {$35.00} overdraft fee ; thereby, dragging my account into a negative status of $ XXXX. The matter was resolved by Wells Fargo ; where, the {$310.00} was credited to my checking account ; but, Wells Fargo neglected to credit my checking account for the {$24.00} overdraft and the {$35.00} overdraft fee. My point is this, had the unauthorized {$310.00} not been charged to my account, my account would have never gone into overdraft status ; where, Wells Fargo would have never charged me an overdraft fee ; therefore, it is only right that Wells Fargo also credit my account the {$24.00} of overdraft and {$35.00} of overdraft fee. My account would have had a {$290.00} positive balance had XXXX not charged my account with the unauthorized {$310.00}. Wells Fargo is not willing to credit my account in the amount of {$58.00}, which is the total from the overdraft ( {$24.00} ) and the overdraft fee ( {$35.00} ). I would like for my account to be adjusted and credited {$58.00} ; the overdraft in the amount of {$24.00}, and the overdraft fee in the amount of {$35.00} ; totaling {$58.00}. The company in which my complaint is about, is Wells Fargo. The people involved are the Wells Fargo bankers/representatives. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX charged my account {$310.00}, without my authorization. On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo retrieved the {$310.00}, by crediting my account ; but, neglected to credit my account the amount of overdraft, {$24.00}, and overdraft fee, {$35.00} ; totaling {$58.00}.

Ms. XXXX kindly waived the late fees but her letter dated XXXX XXXX 2019 indicated my account was being reported as 60 days overdue with the credit reporting companies even though she never mentioned this when we spoke.

If Ms. XXXX had done her job and returned any of the TWO phone calls I made to her and had been as cooperative and helpful as Ms. XXXX, none of this would have happened and it was all over approximately {$37.00}.

Evidently, one of the accounts was closed but the other was left open. In XX/XX/XXXX, a charge of {$49.00} ( credit card annual fee ) was placed on the open account. I had paperless billing so received an email that a statement was available but my online access had been terminated so there was no way to access the account to see the transaction or the balance. I did not pay much attention to it since I believed the accounts had closed. I had no way of knowing that a charge was on one of the accounts. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email indicating that my account was seriously delinquent. I called the number on the email and found out from the Barclay representative about the XX/XX/XXXX charge AND that I had been subsequently charged {$30.00} late fees for the past six months.

I am furious. As a consumer, I feel that I have no power except to simply pay their ridiculous fees. Barclay failed to close the account. Barclay failed to provide adequate means of notice. Barclay told me they adjusted the fees but then subsequently put them right back on without notice or explanation. Barclay is now unable or unwilling to resolve the account. Barclay holds the health of my credit hostage and we, as consumers, have no power to affect the outcome except to simply comply with their business practices.

He said he understood and I wrote on the form I filled out that I DID NOT CONSENT TO AN AUTO LOAN AND WAS NOT APPLYING FOR AN AUTO LOAN. A month later, in XXXX of XXXX, I ran my credit report and saw that in fact XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX HAD RUN AN AUTO LOAN HARD CREDIT INQUIRY ON MY CREDIT REPORT WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION OR CONSENT, THAT MY CREDIT SCORE HAD DROPPED 30 POINTS, AND THAT THIS AUTO LOAN INQUIRY WOULD REMAIN ON MY CREDIT REPORT FOR 2 YEARS through XXXX of XXXX. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they had one of their finance people named XXXX XXXX write a letter confirming that I never took out an auto loan at the time of purchase. However this letter did me no good in terms of repairing my credit report. I also repeatedly fought with Experian, XXXX and XXXX to remove this unauthorized hard auto loan credit inquiry from my credit report. They all refused to remove it from my credit report and told me that this was specifically coded by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time of purchase ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and that only XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX could remove it from my report. They told me to have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX remove it from my report as an \" error ''. For the next five ( 5 ) months, I called and left messages at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Specifically, I asked the General Manager, XXXX XXXX, to return my call about this matter. He NEVER CALLED ME BACK. NOT ONCE. Finally I got his assistant XXXX on the phone and she gave me his email address and that allowed me to email him. I emailed him requesting he remove this UNAUTHORIZED AUTO LOAN CREDIT INQUIRY from my credit report as an \" error '' and he refused to do it. At first he said that the federal law required it ( NOT TRUE ) and then he said that I had signed a credit application ( NOT TRUE EITHER - I WROTE ON THEIR FORM THAT I WAS NOT APPLYING FOR AN AUTO LOAN ). Since I owe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NOT ONE CENT for this car, and since I NEVER APPLIED FOR AN AUTO LOAN, and since I did NOT AUTHORIZE AN AUTO LOAN CREDIT CHECK, it is insane that they refuse to remove it from my credit report. The only explanation for this behavior is that they know they did something they should not have done, and now they have been caught. But instead of fixing the problem, they are making it worse and hoping it will disappear. But I will not disappear and I need it removed from my credit report. I am in the process of trying to buy a house and get a mortgage so having this UNAUTHORIZED AUTO LOAN CREDIT INQUIRY FOR TWO YEARS LONGER on my credit report is extremely damaging and was the whole reason that I paid in full in cash for their XXXX car to begin with.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is This is my 2nd attempt to rectify a serious error on the part of Experian National Consumers Assistance Center. I have been disputing an entry on my credit report listing a Bankruptcy Chapter XXXX- discharged on XX/XX/XXXX for over a year. As proven in the documents I am attaching, there is no way the bankruptcy is validated as the Bankruptcy Courts do not verify them ( see attached letter ), it is not listed on my XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) report ( see attached report ), nor is there a bankruptcy reported on my XXXX report ( see attached report ). To quote the reply by XXXX XXXX Senior Regulatory Affairs Associate from my 1st complaint ( see attached response to my 1st complaint ) Our records indicate that we have contacted the public record vendor to verify the accuracy of the information with which the consumer disagrees. The disputed bankruptcy information was verified as accurately reported and confirmation was mailed to the above-mentioned consumer for review. The only other way it could possibly be reported is through PACER. I have previously requested ( see letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ), and I WILL DO SO AGAIN NOW, Experian provide identifying info of the clerk they spoke to verifying the Bankruptcy as BK Rule 9037 states- \" PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION DEFINED AS INDIVIDUALS SOCIAL SECURITY & TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS, NAMES OF MINOR CHILDREN, LAST FOUR DIGITS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNT NUMBERS, AND DATE OF BIRTH, BE REDACTED FROM DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE COURT. '' Therefore obtaining verification through a subscription to PACER or any other agency is not only a violation of FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 2 ) which requires \" you to notify the party who furnished the disputed information '', Experian would also be in violation of Section 5 ( a ) of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTC Act ) ( 15 USC 45 ) which prohibits \" unfair or deceptive acts or practices '' by purposely reporting information that they have \" assumed '' is verifiable based off circumstance. Experian has failed numerous times to provide me with a copy of any viable evidence, bearing my signature, showing the account is being reported accurately. IN ADDITION, Experian has violated the FCR Act Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) & /or FDCP Act Section 807 ( 8 ) by not placing a notice of my dispute on my credit report w/in 30 days This is my last attempt for them to rectify this serious and inaccurate reporting error. .My next step will be small claims court where I will be seeking {$1000.00} per violation of 1 ) Defamation 2 ) Negligent Enablement of Identity Fraud 3 ) Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I believe the easiest way to explain what has happened is to copy and paste my response to the summons I received regarding Pacific Union 's intent to foreclose on my property : XX/XX/XXXX Re : Case # XXXX Response to Plaintiffs Claim in re : Case # XXXX In the case of Pacific Union v., known as Case # XXXX, please consider this my official response in regard to the claims made by the defendant. 1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I began the official process of requesting a loan modification from Pacific Union. This request was in guidelines for receiving a loan modification from Pacific Union and from XXXX XXXX as the request was 2 years past the original loan modification as indicated by Pacific Union in the complaint. This request was submitted electronically and confirmed received by Pacific Union. 2 ) Between XX/XX/XXXX and the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I was repeatedly asked to resend information in which Pacific Union had already confirmed electronically received. Subsequent conversations and electronic communication verifies this, as well as written requests from Pacific Union. Additionally, Pacific Union had asked for proof of my bankruptcy discharge, which was also sent. 3 ) All requests made by Pacific Union were met by me within their allotted time frame. I received confirmation from Pacific Union that all documentation had been met and that a loan modification was in process. I was told that the modification was within the Underwriters approval and that I would hear from them shortly in regards to the terms of the modification. 4 ) Months passed and I had kept in constant electronic communication, as well as phone calls with various retention specialists as to the progress of my modification. I was constantly told that it was still within the review process. 5 ) After multiple attempts to determine the status of my modification, I resubmitted the entire package on XX/XX/XXXX. 6 ) In a letter received from Pacific Union dated XX/XX/XXXX they had requested additional information to be received within 14 days of their letter. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent the additional information as requested within the time frame of their request. 7 ) In an additional letter received from Pacific Union dated XX/XX/XXXX, Pacific Union requested additional information. It is of note that their letter is dated XX/XX/XXXX and that it was received a full two weeks later after the date of the letter and that within the framework of their letter they state that the additional information requested is due on XX/XX/XXXX. Given that the information they requested was already received electronically and confirmed to be received, the fact that they requested information by XX/XX/XXXX and having not even sent the request until their own acknowledged date of XX/XX/XXXX, suggests that there was a willful intent to disqualify me from additional modification assistance. This practice, along with multiple letters with multiple deadline dates also suggests that there was a willful attempt to be misleading, cause confusion, delay the process of modification until they could process a foreclosure against myself and the property. 8 ) In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Pacific Union indicated that they had received my request, once again, and that they needed additional documentation. This letter included a deadline very specifically of XX/XX/XXXX. As of the date of this summons response, this deadline date has not passed. 9 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent the documentation, as requested to Pacific Union electronically and received confirmation that it had been received by Pacific Union. 10 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a certified letter from Pacific Union stating that they are now suing me for the mortgage balance. This date is noteworthy in that Pacific Union has stated unequivocally in their own letter as referenced in Item # 8 that I had until XX/XX/XXXX to comply with their additional request of information. 11 ) To date, I have not received any confirmation or denial officially of either of my loan modification requests. As to my knowledge, the first request, made back in XX/XX/XXXX may even still be within the Underwriting Department awaiting official approval or denial. It is in my opinion that Pacific Union has shown a willful and malicious intent to confuse, delay and ultimately deny any and all attempts by me to gain a mortgage modification which would allow me to retain occupancy of the property and to alleviate any back due mortgage payments, interests and lawyer fees. It is also my opinion that Pacific Union may be in violation of the Federal Law which prohibits Dual Tracking. I am asking that the court suspend any further foreclosure proceedings by Pacific Union Financial until a settlement conference can take place between myself and Pacific Union Financial. I will officially request a settlement conference of the court with my next correspondence. It is also my intent to pursue legal action and retain legal counsel against Pacific Union and to possibly file a suit in regards to Dual Tracking and Unfair Competition as allowed by Indiana Law. I also intend to submit a formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in regards to what I feel is a violation of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I opened Citi Priority checking and savings account because of the Citi sign-on bonus promotion in XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I called Citi and they confirmed that I have met all the requirements for the bonus. Shortly after this call, the next time I checked my account online, my savings account no longer exists. Multiple calls ( about 15 of them ) led me to the fraud department with conflicting messages but ultimately told me that the account is blocked and that I can only \" wit until the review is done '' for undetermined time. There is no supervisor or anyone with authority in any of the calls who can tell me the reason of the closure and a way to speed up the process because it is being processed by the \" back office '' with no possible contact, even by the fraud department. During those calls, no one offered me to do any type of verification process which I believe is the only way to verify and unblock the account. At this point, not only I have lost access of my own money which I desperately need, I also have lost the opportunity to earn a higher interest on the money, not to mention the time I spent on the phone with Citi. In addition, because I am in need of the fund, the situation forced me to take a new loan which costs me interest/transaction fee. Other customers with similar complaints can be found here ( and also in XXXX website ) : XXXX : XXXX? XXXX https : XXXX Update as of XX/XX/XXXX : I have made a complaint through XXXX ( Complaint ID : XXXX ), and the responses from Citi have been very unprofessional and unsatisfactory : 1. The first response was to extend the response deadline for another 14 days. 2. The second response referred me to their original letter and instructions, which I clearly followed until I reached a dead end. This shows that they did not read the original complaint. This seems like a fraud at two different levels : FALSE ADVERTISING and WRONGFUL ASSET FREEZING. Was the sign-on bonus jus t a way for Citi to lure customers into putting money in their account, just to freeze it with no proper communication to the customers and with no proper process ( it has been 30+ days since the fund was blocked.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I monitor my bank accounts every day, each morning. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX when i woke up and looked at my WF account, i had noticed my account was in negative status. I was curious as to why, saw transactions and there was an auto charge from company called XXXX for {$88.00}. This transaction WHICH was not even processed just initiated caused my account to go negative. I was not aware of this auto charge so immediately i called the company to seek refund but they stated they couldn't until they received items that were shipped. I just received the items today, XX/XX/2019 therefore i will be shipping back to company these products to initiate {$88.00} refund. With that i believe all the Overdraft Fee 's i've been applied should be refunded because if this charge never went through then i would not have been in this position. Now I have {$100.00} going into WF direct deposit into this account that will be wasted due to negative balance. I have already shifted my direct deposit to another financial institution that i know confidently would have addressed these charges. I feel that if WF had processed the transactions in the order that they were initiated i would not be in this position. So that morning, XX/XX/XXXX i called WF XXXX # to discuss charges. The rep stated that the XXXX charges hadn't gone through yet which i understood but because it was processed this caused my account to go negative. I don't understand. Rep was not helpful at all and i was not in the best of moods when i called she then offered to transfer me to manager and i waited for quite for moments before i had to hang up and actually walk into work at WF. WF then has called but due to work not able to answer until Friday, XX/XX/XXXX when I returne their call. First thing REP asked me was how was i going to pay the OD fee. I stated i am not and i am acutally in process of filing compliaint to CFPB. He then stated ok, let me transfer you to Office of the President and because of waiting for 5 minutes on hold i hung up as i did not have time to wait due to meeting. I have not since discussed with them as I was waiting for package to arrive and return to start that refund process first from XXXX to lower the negative balance. On Friday, my balance decreased by {$100.00} due to automatic deposit from work which that was a waste of {$100.00}. I literally week before ran into this and they were helpful in crediting me 75 % of the overdraft fees because XXXX charged my account in error and i called asap to have resolved account credited i believe same day or next day. These transactions were for {$3.00} caused my account to go negative for less than {$10.00} and WF and their absorbent OD fees charged me {$70.00} in fees for less than {$10.00}, very sad and unfortunate how much this organization makes just in FEE 's - overdraft fees, monthly {$5.00} service fees to maintain a savings account and however else they are making money and attempting to rebuild customer trust as well as employee trust.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I filed this complaint against the U.S. Bank National Association for problems with my annual percentage rate ( APR ) interest on my general purpose credit card, U.S. Bank Platinum Visa, which credit account I have held with U.S. Bank National Association for approximately ten years. I am asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate predatory lending practices and collusion amid banks that provide consumer credit and mortgage financing products to low- and middle-income debtors. For five years or more, U.S. Bank National Association has charged me annual percentage interest rates in excess of 21 percent on my principal balance. During the past six months, my APR rate has varied between 23.47 and 23.99 percent. To the best of my recollection, I called U.S. Bank Customer Service on XXXX XXXX, 2017, to request a lower APR rate on purchases on my U.S. Bank Platinum Card. As I recall, I spoke with Customer Service Representative XXXX. During our call, I asked XXXX if my APR interest rate on purchases could be adjusted from its current level ( in excess of 23 percent ) to a more manageable rate of 12.99 percent. XXXX and I argued that the current APR rate on purchases, based on the Prime Rate, made it impossible for me, at my income level, to pay off my balance owed to U.S. Bank National Association. I asked XXXX why he was charging me such a high balance when I had a good payment history, having made payments in excess of the minimum almost every month for at least two years. I told XXXX that I felt U.S. Bank National Association 's object was not to help me build good credit, but to keep me indebted to the bank for life. I told XXXX that another creditor had given me an APR interest rate of 3.25 percent, enabling me to pay off my balance during the course of several years. I asked XXXX why my request for a 12.99 percent APR rate was not considered reasonable. I told XXXX I refused to pay the minimum payment of {$340.00}, owed to U.S. Bank National Association for the billing period from XX/XX/XXXXto XXXX XXXX, 2017 ( i.e., the XXXX 2017 billing period ). I told XXXX I refused to pay U.S. Bank if they continued to charge me \" usurious '' interest. At that point, XXXX put me on a brief hold. When he returned to our call, he stated that I could have a four percent APR interest rate if I agreed to allow U.S. Bank Nationwide nail Association to cancel my U.S. Bank Platinum Visa Card and send it into collections. I told XXXX that I did not want the card sent to collections, as such action would damage my credit rating. XXXX called me from XXXX ( XXXX, Kansas ) on Saturday, XXXX XXXX, 2017, at XXXX XXXX EST. Not recognizing the phone number, I did not answer the call. XXXX left a voicemail for me, directing me to call him back at a DIFFERENT number, XXXX than the one from which he called me. I did not respond to his voicemail. U.S. Bank called me again on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX 2017, at XXXX XXXX EST. I was working during that time and did not answer the call. The call came from XXXX. U.S. Bank called me again on Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2017, at XXXX XXXX EST. As I had a medical appointment on my calendar, I did not answer the call. The call came from XXXX. XXXX called me again today, Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2017, at XXXX XXXX EST. He called me from a third number, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, Kansas ). Having no scheduling conflict, I took his call. XXXX informed me that he could not honor my request to have my APR interest rate lowered from 23.99 percent to 12.99 percent. He told me he would offer me a 4.99 percent APR ( so, an APR increased by 0.99 percent since our previous conversation of XXXX XXXX, 2017 ) if I agreed to allow U.S. Bank National Association to cancel my card and enter my account into collections. I told XXXX that I wanted the low interest rate but would like to see the Terms and Conditions of the hardship plan to know how the card cancelation might affect my credit rating. I asked XXXX if he could email me the Terms and Conditions. XXXX said he could not. I then told him I would refrain from making a decision about payment until I had contacted my credit bureau ( which bureau I found out can not give financial advice ).\n",

Loancare never sent me a document for a new loan and secretly slapped 15 years of loan without notifying me or my agreement. There is a BIG discrepancy of the statement and the actual amortization schedule to XX/XX/XXXX. The statement said the new monthly payment of {$1100.00} due in XX/XX/XXXX includes principal payment of {$870.00} and interest of {$100.00} but the amortization schedule says for maturation date of XX/XX/XXXX, the payment for XX/XX/XXXX includes interest of {$100.00} but principle payment of only {$74.00}. Where does the rest of {$790.00} go if not to my principle??? The new loan I would not want to extend my loan whatsoever, especially with such a shady company like Loancare.

      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/, 2019 I had received a notification my credit score had gone down which I am in the process of purchasing a home and can not have it go down, so I logged online to see the reason it had gone down and the notification stated I had one of my credit cards maxed out to be specific my JCPenny Store Credit Card maxed out. I was confused and thought to myself this is clearly fraud because I dont have my JCPenny Credit Card maxed out and the notification continued to say make a payment and bring the balance down to bring your credit score back up. I immediately called JCPenny customer service XXXX at XXXX central standard time on XX/XX/, 2019. I explain to the customer service representative that it shows me maxed out on my credit card and this is wrong and clearly fraud and she stated it was correct that they changed my credit limit to {$280.00}. I asked her on what grounds did they change it and this is deceptive business practices because they did not inform me that they had changed it or why, that I received not notification whatsoever. I told her that as a consumer who agreed to a certain amount when I initially applied for the card a year ago and allowed them to run my credit a year ago and was approved for {$500.00} that this has been my a credit amount this entire time. I told her I have never paid late or gone over my credit limit. The representative said that is correct you were approved for {$500.00} about a year ago and never paid late and said however we have a system that monitors your spending habits and will match your credit line to your spending habits, so I tell the representative okay let me make sense of what you are saying and said since I dont max out my card or use the {$500.00} every month your system is monitoring my spending habits and your system changed my credit limit to match my actual spending amount and she said yes. I tell the representative again this is deceptive business practices to monitor my spending or any consumers spending and based on those grounds they changed my credit limit and thats where I have an issue because it was changed without my knowledge and this hurt my credit score. I told her because you monitored my spending and changed my limit to what I actually spend which is roughly {$280.00} a month and me having a balance of {$270.00} has a negative impact on me and this information reports to credit bureau as a card maxed out and to make a payment to bring balance down and this would then raise your credit score and thats where I have a problem and issue with these deceptive business practices. This company completed deceptive business practices by monitoring my spending but to change my credit limit based on spending habits and not inform the consumer is deceptive and wrong. The representative apologizes and says we can raise it again but to raise a credit limit we have to run your credit report again which I declined and told her why would I run my credit report again to have the same limit I initially started with. I told her I gave you permission to run it a year ago and agreed to a certain amount and for what for you to monitor my spending and just change it. I informed her I was gon na file a complaint because they did not notify me in any way, shape or form and if it was not because of my alert from credit bureaus that there had been a change to credit score I would never have known the amount changed. I told her I could have decided to purchase something for someone as a gift and my card would have been declined and again she apologizes and says lets run your credit score again to raise it back up for you. This has been the most deceptive act I have ever come across, for your spending habits to be monitored and your credit line changed based on those grounds.\n",

So now the payroll checks the I have handed out will be most likely be returned as OVERDRAWN.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I opened a credit card with US Bank/ XXXX Mastercard several years ago. It is my understanding that monthly billing statements are to by law to be sent out 21 days prior to due date. For several years I repeatedly did not receive bills from this one company on time, many times receiving them a week after the due date. I repeatedly had to fight them for late charges and paid late fees several times as a result. This is the only credit account out of a dozen accounts I have that I have had this problem with. I repeatedly verified my address with the company and they always had the correct address. I am currently trying to fix these errors on my credit report. The account representatives at XXXX Mastercard have told me over the phone they will not correct my information on file with the credit reporting agencies, and the disputes department puts you on hold for 45+ minutes when you call to try to fix the problem. I have hired a company that disputes accounts but they have not been successful either. Based on my experience with this company, I believe I am not the only person having problems with this company. I do not use the card very much anymore as a result of their poor business practices but would still like the three negative items on my credit report removed from by this organization. Thanks for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, UT XXXX\n",
      "VALUE OF S is In XX/XX/XXXX I decided it was time to repair my credit and buy a house. I had several outstanding credit card collections that needed to be paid off. XXXX XXXX XXXX had three of those collections. In order to pay off all my collections I took out a high interest personal loan at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called every single collection agency on my credit report and paid every one of them with the exception of the one in question. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid XXXX XXXX XXXX for 2 of the three collection accounts. First one was for {$290.00} and the second was for {$740.00}. The XXXX one I couldn't pay, they told me that because it was already entered in a Judgment, they couldn't receive payment. I called every payday from XXXX until the end of XXXX trying to pay this debt and finish my credit repair. Every time I called I was told its still in the legal department and can't make a payment. At this point I was starting to get upset and frustrated with XXXX XXXX. In early XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX in XXXX Arizona stating the XXXX XXXX XXXX \" acknowledges receipt of goods '' and was \" a full satisfaction of judgment ''. Fast forward to today, XX/XX/XXXX, I am in the middle of a home purchase where escrow closes on XX/XX/XXXX and my lender called me to say XXXX XXXX is now saying I owe them {$1200.00}. We ( mortgage company and me ) thought that with the letter from the court they would fix this. I argued on the phone with a XXXX XXXX rep for over an hour. I finally was so upset that I said I would just pay the balance because I need to get this fixed so I can move forward with my home purchase. I was then transferred to XXXX, what they keep calling the legal department at XXXX XXXX. I explained to the new representative that I just wanted to pay the balance. He looked up my account and then asked \" you live in Oregon? '' I said \" yes ''. He then proceeds to tell me that he can not accept payment because XXXX is not authorized to collect in Oregon. I am making this complaint because it is urgent that this is taken care of or my home purchase could fall through and I already gave my landlord my 30 day notice back on the XX/XX/XXXX. I am desperate and have really been trying to pay this for almost a year.\n",

We ( my XXXX and I ) went to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX based on a ad they were running on television. We had absolutely no idea how this worked because I did not go to college. I just wanted something better for my XXXX. Without hesitation they approved me for the loan when I only claimed XXXX a year. I was a bit surprised I got approved but it was only for XXXX and I thought that covered the first year and he could get financial aid for the XXXX year. Then, later, I found out after he transferred to XXXX, that the loan amount was {$8000.00} per semester so it ended up to be several loans for him to continue in school. Yes, this was ignorance on my part but I believe they intentionally tried to deceive me into enrolling because we were a low income family and they preyed on this type of situation. While in School in XXXX XXXX was hit by a hit and run car while riding his bicycle to school. He had no insurance and therefore was hit again with many doctor bills which the hospital eventually wrote off because of the hit and run. In the meantime, I went through a divorce and could not afford to get any more loans and I knew the ones I had were going to be very difficult for me to pay back. XXXX couldnt get approved for loans because of his doctor bills ( before they were written off ) .They were happy to give me another loan, though. I refused so XXXX had to quit school with no degree and try to find s job to support himself in XXXX.

They ( at the time XXXX XXXX ) had me go through the grueling process only to tell me at the end of the process that my XXXX loan didnt qualify for this type of repayment plan. So, Once again they recommended forbearance which is what they easily recommended every time. They ( now XXXX Who bought out XXXX XXXX ) has done this to me more than once. My loan went from {$40000.00} in the last nine years to {$110000.00}. To date, the XXXX XXXX XXXX has been closed and recently the XXXX XXXX XXXX was closed. Both have been accused of predatory lending and claims in reference to the school and what kind of degrees and job placement you could receive as opposed to the money you spend on your degree. These were nothing but lies. Since we couldnt pay the loans and pay housing and such to function, over the years weve both had to go into forbearance and now the loans have tripled.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..\n",

I remember getting emails from Experian that I honestly thought were scam emails and deleted them. I was finally able to contact Experian and was told that I had a membership ( which I was unaware of ) and that I could cancel it which I immediately did. I explained the situation to the representative who mentioned that another department could confirm whether or not I ever used the service and would handle the reimbursement and that she could transfer me to that department. I was never successfully transferred because the phone call dropped when she attempted to transfer me. It seems like once I cancelled the membership, Experian has been unavailable to discuss the reimbursement. I have been trying to contact Experian almost daily since then to no avail. The customer service phone numbers listed for Experian online literally reroute you unsuccessfully ( including dropping your calls ).

All documents were turned over to the XXXX Sheriff 's Department for fingerprinting and analysis since the people in the local branch of SunTrust 's Fraud Department did not want to take responsibility for clearing a fraudulent check.

( i ) Re \" blocking '' my credit card from any use on or about XXXX XX/XX/2019, please see my letter sent to Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, CEO and Manager, PFCU dated XXXX XX/XX/2019 ( letter copied below ). [ my address ] XXXX XX/XX/2019 Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, CEO and Manager Pentagon Federal Credit Union XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Virginia XXXX PH : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Mr. XXXX : I am writing to report my consternation and disgust with Pentagon Federal Credit Unions ( PFCU ) apparent recent now-you-have-credit-but-now-you-dont-have-credit policy regarding my VISA credit card. As a PFCU member since the mid-XXXXXXXX I have had a VISA with PFCU for several decades. I have never had a late payment nor have ever overdrawn my credit limit of said VISA. Inexplicably and absent any notice, yesterday ( XX/XX/2019 ) as I attempted to make a VISA purchase for {$56.00} I found PFCU had blocked my VISA. What followed at PFCU for nearly one hour, as I spoke by my cell phone to numerous putative PFCU employees in the USA and overseas, was clearly unconscionable negligence. Each employee tried to explain the blocking error ( most, directly contradicting what the previous employee had stated ) while transferring my call repeatedly to get to the PFCU staff who would/could unblock my VISA. First, the cardholder service employee ( XXXX ) stated my VISA was blocked because : there was no phone number associated with credit card. I replied my VISA was decades in existence and my phone number had not changed during that time period. Further, I was using my cell phone to speak to them. Thereafter, the PFCU employee admitted she could see my cell phone number associated with my VISA in her database. Second, the PFCU employee said that someone from XXXX had tried to contact me by phone to verify an XXXX payment that had been entered three ( 3 ) times. I asked how much XXXX had billed, PFCU employee replied {$440.00}, I confirmed that amount was authorized by me. Employee, XXXX ID : XXXX ( XXXX, OR ), could not explain his own assertion the {$440.00} payment had been entered 3X on XX/XX/2019 by XXXX, so he stated XXXX could not contact you [ XXXX XXXX ] by phone to verify the charge. I responded : I have a VISA with PFCU, not XXXX. I have no business relationship with XXXX ; and, had I been so contacted, would logically assume credit fraud by an unknown third party ( XXXX ) against my VISA. If PFCU needs to verify a PFCU-VISA charge, PFCU can text-or voice-message my phone while showing PFCU-Phone-ID when contacting me. Finally, XXXX transferred me to XXXX employee ID XXXX apparently in a XXXX-call-center ( PH : XXXX or XXXX ). XXXX spoke incomprehensible English and could not understand my questions sufficiently to reply. I ended the call and recalled PFCU cardholder service ( XXXX ), XXXX answered and I explained I wanted to have my VISA unblocked. XXXX said she would have to transfer me to which I replied I needed to speak English. XXXX stated she would remain on the call with me. XXXX answered the phone and asked me a variety of questions ( my birthdate, social security last-4-digits, etc. ) concluding with : were you forced- or coerced to make purchases to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX , NY XXXX ? I indicated that those were my purchases and asked if she was forced or coerced to question my competence based on my birthdate? XXXX responded my VISA would be unblocked. On XX/XX/2019, I again phoned the PFCU cardholder service ( XXXX ). XXXX, employee ID XXXX, answered and confirmed my VISA had been unblocked minutes ago. Both my husband and I travel. For the past two years PFCU told us that prior travel notification to PFCU re our PFCU VISA cards was no longer required. In fact, PFCU told XXXX his VISA would be usable without prior travel notification to northern XXXX in XXXX 2019. On XX/XX/2019, I was told prior travel notification to PFCU is a requirement to avoid having your VISA blocked when used away from permanent home area. Which is correct : prior travel notification is necessary or not necessary? We have directly conflicting travel notification requirement depending on what day of the week or PFCU employee we ask re the need for prior PFCU travel notification. My PFCU VISA expressly affirms credit that I can not be certain is available to me because of PFCUs unexplained/unjustified blocked VISA from my use. Further, knowing misleading/erroneous and contradictory information stated by PFCU employees, apparently to cover their mistakes or potentially unlawful policies, belies good faith business practice. My concern is that actions and/or policies promulgated by PFCU employees herein described may be prohibited by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 USC 1691 et seq. and the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1751 et seq., If said actions continue or repeat, I will furnish a copy of this letter and updated PFCU actions to the Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration with respect to Pentagon Federal Credit Union. Sincerely, [ signature ] ( ii ) Re denial of my credit card ( annual dues ) payments on or about XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/2019 to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( hereinafter, XXXX ) and the XXXX XXXX XXXX and repeated \" hang-up '' telephone calls with no messages to my cell phone from PFCU phone number ( XXXX ) from on or about XX/XX/2019 to XX/XX/2019. On or about XX/XX/2019, the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( hereinafter, XXXX XXXX ) called to notify me my credit card ( annual dues ) payment had been \" declined '' by PFCU. Immediately I called PFCU and asked why my credit card payment to XXXX XXXX had been \" declined. '' PFCU employee ID XXXX, \" XXXX '' replied : \" XXXX XXXX entered an incorrect cvv number. '' I replied no cvv number was requested by XXXX XXXX ( nor was cvv ever required for 8 years prior I paid my dues via PFCU card ), so \" XXXX '' next stated \" XXXX XXXX entered the wrong expiration date [ on my credit card ]. '' Contradicting PFCU \" explanations, '' XXXX XXXX employee \" XXXX '' ( XXXX ) affirmed my payment was \" [ PFCU- ] declined '' rather than showing \" keystroke error, '' latter, as PFCU employees had opined untruthfully. I retained a photocopy of my credit card payment receipt US mailed to XXXX XXXX showing all credit card numbers including the expiration date are noted clearly and unequivocally as XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) affirmed. In summary, PFCU provided no lawful or even rational explanation for PFCU \" declining '' my payment to XXXX XXXX ( and XXXX? ). This PFCU \" now you have credit, now you do not have credit '' absent any lawful explanation appears to be in plain violation of both the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 USC 1691 et seq. and Federal Credit Union Act, 12 USC 1751 et seq., hence I am respectfully requesting my complaint herein be without delay transmitted to the Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration and/or OIG National Credit Union Administration as specified by said statutes and/or Federal Trade Commission as CFPB deems appropriate.\n",

The woman I spoke to on the phone assured me this was clearly an error and that she would correct the information. I followed up and checked the website a few days later only to discover that the information had not been corrected. The following weeks I continued to check the website and the amount due still had not been corrected. I called multiple times and when I did get someone on the telephone they assured me the information had been corrected online, but that it didn't show the corrected amount on my end. ( I have attached call logs verifying dates/times. ) I contacted the office and asked to pay the original amount due of {$160.00}.

I did have an appointment scheduled to do a final walkthrough of the premises however, the apartment manager never showed up to that appointment. I went to the front office and physically handed the apartment keys to the front desk person. I was told that this was acceptable since the office manager never made it to the walkthrough appointment that we had scheduled. I have attached copies of pictures of the apartment. The picture of the laundry room is not in my building. The community laundry room is in a separate building however, Ive included this picture to show the condition of the apartment complex. The picture of the ceiling in the bathroom was from a leak in the upstairs apartment. It took over a week for this to get fixed and consequently I was without water in the bathroom and had not shower. The pictures of the insects are just one example of the inhabitability of the unit ; the picture of the thermostat references how hot the apartment was w/o air conditioning. It was over 90 degrees. I had my toddler daughter living with me, so it was concerning to have her in that high heat for so long. It took over a week as well to get the air conditioner fixed. The living conditions at the apartment complex was horrible as referenced by the attached pictures. I had cockroaches the entire time I lived there, even with the unit being sprayed bi-weekly. There are other fees as well that they claim I owe. On the statement they gave me they claim that I owe for the entire month of XXXX although I only lived there 8 days. They are charging me a concession charge back fee of {$460.00} which I believe is for the discount I received for being in the medical field. They are charging re-letting fees in the amount of {$540.00}, which are again unnecessary as I gave appropriate and timely notice to vacate. They are charging a notice fulfillment fee for {$1200.00}. This amount is more than double my initial rent. My monthly rent was {$600.00}. These additional fees are fraudulent! The apartment complex has numerous complaints filed with the XXXX for their unethical and shady practices. I am formally requesting that the law offices of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) remove the collection from my credit report as Ive made SEVERAL attempts to pay with no resolution. This account should never have gone to collections in the first place. This collection is completely unsubstantiated. This incorrect reporting of a collection is harming my credit score and this line item needs to be removed from my credit report. I have contacted the ( 3 ) bureaus to remove this however, I have not been successful.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is My grandfather, who has been declared incompetent, opened this account for me many years ago for the purposes of funding anything I needed while I was in college. Recently, my grandfather became incapacitated and my mother and grandmother both have POA 's signed by the grandfather ( before he was incapacitated ) and filed with the clerk of court. He and we have always been told that when I reach the age of XXXX, the account would automatically transfer as long as I told the bank to transfer the funds and signed a form. Since XXXX, when I turned XXXX, the bank has not allowed me to get any funds out of the account and are demanding that I have a petition filed with the clerk of court and signed. Upon visiting the XXXX County clerk of court, they would not allow the petition to be filed because the law is clear and although my grandfather is incapacitated, he is not refusing me access to my funds. The petition the SECU is demanding to be filed with the clerk is only for someone who is disputing disbursement. We have visited the SECU over 5 times, the clerk 3 times and talked to several people at the corporate office over the phone and they will not release the funds. Furthermore, they indicated the disallowing of disbursement in my account so I could not visit the XXXX branch to get money out as initially done in 2017. That branch originally told us that we would just need to sign a form, after visiting XXXX, they too no longer allowed us to remove any money from the account. I have wasted lots of gas and time trying to get my money, being told 3 different stories and still not being allowed access. If my mother can't exercise the POA because she was told my grandfather doesn't own the account ; if the clerk will not allow me to even file the petition ; if I am not allowed to walk in and ask for the account to be transferred ... then who owns the account? and who has access? It appears the bank is not making sense of its own rules, but my interpretation of the law is clear. Pursuant to NC Gen Stat 33A-20. XXXX XXXX has reached the age of XXXX years old, the age of majority in North Carolina. The law states a custodian shall transfer custodial property to the minor upon the date the minor reaches the age of XXXXTransfer all assets to XXXX XXXX under a new account. This has caused a great amount of distress and angst for the family as the funds are needed to continue my education and pay for expenses. I have had to continuously borrow money to pay for these things so far.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I lost my job in XXXX of XXXX. I contacted Loan Care to report my job status. However, I still had my mortgage payment for the month of XXXX XXXX. I tried to work out some type of modification with them to save my house. I made the XXXX payment and filled out the documentation for application for a loan modification. I contacted the bank for 3 months not hearing anything from them. I eventually spoke with a representative who told me that because I made the XXXX Payment I no longer qualified for assistance. I had to miss 3 consecutive payments in order to be considered for loan modification. During that time my house was in trouble! I was able to find two part time jobs and submitted my pay stubs every 30 days and bank statements, in addition to my unemployment for the short time that I did receive it. There was still no action. I had to wait another 90 days to get someone to help but that only gave me a partial payment plan. Eventually they gave me partial payment, what they referred to as a forbearance payment, of which half of the original mortgage. I paid that until I was still not getting any resolution to a loan modification and realizing none of the payments appear to be applied to my balance. I was steadily incurring fees and more fees. I got a full time position with one of the part time jobs and my income I was receiving was still lower than my previous job. Eventually, I had to hire an attorney from XXXX XXXX XXXX with the payments that I was making to Loan Care because they were not trying to help me. I contacted the attorney office regularly to see if they were getting anywhere and informed them of my status continued to forward bank statements paystubs and letters they requested. Even with the attorneys this took another 7 months in order for Loan Care to come to a trial payment period where my payments are now higher than my original payment of {$1200.00}. My payments are now {$1300.00}! I have made all the payments timely as requested. As of today, I still have not received documentation of what my new payments will be or if I should continue to pay the amount of {$1300.00}. I have done everything they have asked and gone above beyond plus. Today my credit has been affected and I am considering filing for bankruptcy for protection.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On or around XX/XX/19, I called Citibank requesting closure of two of my three accounts. I transferred the cash from the two accounts into a new Citibank Accelerate Savings with a higher APY. For some reason, one of my accounts was not closed. When I logged into mobile banking today, I noticed that the account balance was -$XXXX. It's so unfair that they charge me a fee for an account that I requested to be closed and that was at a $XXXX balance. When I called to get the account closed again today (XX/XX/19) the representative informed me that the charge is still pending and can't be either investigated or reversed until it's posted to my account, so I'd have to call back in tomorrow. When I asked them if they could just post it, she declined and offered the same solution. I'm extremely frustrated that 1) I've attempted to close an account and that it never happened. 2) I was charged a fee that brought my account balance negative.3) That the representative couldn't refund me $XXXX for their error.4) That I'd have to call back in to get the fee reversed. I'm not sure what your account agreement says, but it's unbelievably unfair that you'd charge a fee when the account balance is $XXXX.\n",

It is very frustrating that after making multiple phone calls and submitting a fraud claim USAA is still holding my husband and liable for the full amount. While we understand that our daughter made a terrible mistake, USAA should have stopped all transactions from going through on this account. We have also been informed by a USAA representative name XXXX that the account activity that reported as being unauthorized was never flagged as fraudulent and were just allowed to go through. The account has been overdrawn for XXXX and now they have offset our accounts, which is financially devastating our family and leaving us unable to pay our mortgages and car bills. They have applied a temporary credit on the fraudulent transactions but have still frozen our accounts while they are conducting their investigation. It is my understanding that the purpose of the credits are to keep their customers life from being interrupted while they conduct their investigation? This is just disheartening because of the number of years we have been with USAA ( almost 20 ). Any assistance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Hello, On XX/XX/XXXX I received a Escrow Check in the Amount of {$570.00}. My Mortgage was {$1500.00} prior to this refund. My mortgage increases to {$1500.00}. I cash the Check. On XX/XX/XXXX, I receive notice that my Escrow is short by {$1300.00}. I have two options, do nothing and my Mortgage goes from {$1500.00} to {$1700.00} or pay the shortage of {$1300.00} and my Mortgage goes from {$1500.00} to {$1600.00}. I choose to pay the {$1300.00}. So at that time I am obviously irritated and call a Wells Fargo Rep., she tells me I should not have cashed the check. So in my mind why send it in the 1st place. So the Bank used this loophole to raise my mortgage? On XX/XX/XXXX, I receive another Escrow Check in the Amount of {$460.00}. So I again call Wells Fargo and talk to a representative who tells me that the escrow is evaluated every year in XX/XX/XXXX and that all escrow overages have to be returned to the customer. I just got my XX/XX/XXXX Tax evaluation and my property has increased in value from XXXX to XXXX. Obviously, the Taxes will increase and again I will be short on my Escrow Account and get to look forward to another Mortgage increase. This was explained to the representative and she told me she had no control over the tax increase. I get that and suggested that I do not cash the Check and she basically told me I had to. So, my thought is to cash the check and put it back into my escrow account as I pay it on line and have that option. She did not confirm or deny if this was acceptable, but did say even if I wasn't short in escrow come next XX/XX/XXXX I could expect to see an increase in my mortgage to cover the escrow shortage on paper to cover the tax increase, really? Again, I feel this is a game played by this lender to constantly increase your mortgage every 2 years and it is not right! I should be able to add more escrow monthly to avoid a mortgage increase. I am XXXX, and really do not feel that my income will increase to offset this increase every 2 years. What is the escrow overage limit defined by the government that has to be returned to the lender?

In short, I did not have to be delinquent to get into the FHA HAMP. Flagstar had treated me as a delinquent the entire time I was being serviced by them when in fact I was current. They did a \" lockout '' where they switched the locks on my front door. They have been coming into my home and on occasions small items were missing or damaged. I think they worked with other creditors of mine to help them collect their money from me in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. They have reported me to the three credit bureau reports as delinquent even to this day for periods of time when I am in fact current. Please see attached letter from the former President of Flagstar Bank. I have contacted numerous local, state, and federal agencies to help with no success. I am looking for the release of the contingent lien and for a XX/XX/XXXX 1099 form for the forgiveness of debt and for my credit bureau reports to be corrected to reflect current and for interest on my money while it was in the suspense account, and for reimbursement of my locks. I should get more money for intentional infliction of emotional distress ; however, I realize that is very unlikely.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Hello, I wanted to use my Best Buy credit card on XX/XX/2018 at the Best Buy in XXXX, NY when purchasing a television as I was told I would received a certain discount. However, when I tried to use it they said it had already expired and I need to renew the card. I agreed and for this they called a girl who gave me a form to fill. I did that, and they said that this would be a new card so I would get a 10 % discount. I was more than happy. I had to wait for about an hour to receive approval after which they charged the television on that account. I had that delivered to my house later that week and have payed off the amount. But, in XX/XX/XXXX when I went to make the remaining payment I noticed I was charged for something I did not purchase and it was done in XXXX, NY. I have not purchased it and it was definitely not me as I did not even have the credit card in my possession. I did not receive the card. I called the customer service but they were not helpful. I went to the store in XXXX and spoke with a representative there, letting them know that if someone were to purchase such a big amount, they should have checked the identification for confirmation. The amount I was charged for was {$3000.00}, and the bill i received recently has an additional charge of {$1200.00}. The rep said they would investigate the charges, and I would receive a new credit card later which I did. But after all this time, I just received a letter saying they have completed the investigation and I am responsible for the amount due! I fail to understand why I should be paying for something I never purchased. Did the cashier check to see if the credit card was mine? I did not even receive the card when the purchase was made. Please let me know how I can go about this. I am unemployed, and have no reason to purchase something I can not afford. These purchases were not made by me and I have let the company know but they still hold me responsible for the charges. Please help. Thank you.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is -My wife and I signed a contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX timeshare in XXXX . - The contract was subject to misrepresentation, and fraud. We had already paid {$3300.00} US dollars, which represents a 40 % of the entire amount, and never received any services, because they couldn't provide what we were promised at the time of the signing. - When we tried to cancel the contract, XXXX XXXX XXXX didn't answer. - Now, this foreign Company that doesn't comply with XXXX contract standards, is using a US Company, Monterey Collections, to collect money for services they didn't provide. This is what happened : On XX/XX/XXXX, we signed a timeshare contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. At the presentation, we were five adults and two small children. The first thing they asked was if we were American Citizens, because the opportunity they were offering was only for the US market. We were there from the morning to the end of the afternoon, they offered alcohol to the adults and games to the children, and they promised several benefits, until we all agreed in the terms of the contract. The main selling point was that we could adjust 7 nights in a single room, to 5 nights in a double room, to accommodate the whole family. For that, we only had to use what they called \" preferred points '', that were available in low season, without additional payment. All 5 adults made emphasis in this, because our main driver was for the whole family to share vacation together. Like I said, this was the biggest selling point. On XX/XX/XXXX, we called to make a reservation, just to find out, that there was a {$450.00} fee for using the \" preferred points ''. Such fees were never mentioned by the sellers, and they are not written in the contract. After several calls, one of the agents told us that the contract is governed by the Book a Rules.This book was given to us after the contract was signed, with other brochures and timeshare information. After several calls, they wouldn't provide us what they had promised the day of the signing. So, on XX/XX/XXXX we emailed XXXX XXXX XXXX, expressing our intention to cancel the contract, they didn't respond. We sent the same cancellation letter through certified mail, and it was returned to us, unopened. We continued receiving emails and calls from a company named XXXX XXXX , XXXX, based in USA, in charge of collecting payments, but when we asked them about the contract and cancellation intention, they just said they are a third party, and that we have to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX directly. XXXX XXXX, XXXX has several complaints in XXXX for the same problem with XXXX XXXX XXXX 's fraudulent contract. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a pdf document in our personal email, and have been receiving collection calls, and voice-messages in our personal cellphones during working hours, from Monterey Financial Services, trying to collect the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. What steps can we take to protect our good standing credit records, and dispute this fraudulent debt from a foreign Company, accused by several American consumers of having misleading and dishonest contracts?\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Experian makes it very difficult to place a credit freeze on your account in the event of suspected identity theft ( we accidentally gave sensitive financial information to a phishing email on XX/XX/25 and tried to freeze our credit on the same day ). It seems that they do this intentionally as placing a credit freeze can be accomplished fairly easily online at the other two credit agencies. It is similarly difficult to place a fraud alert with experian compared with the other credit agencies. At this point we have been unable to place a credit freeze with experian and we are having to mail documents just to place a fraud alert. We have already placed credit freezes with the other credit agencies, which again was fairly straight forward. Experian does apparently allow for a credit freeze to be placed by mail, however due to the outrageous amount of documents they request be sent by mail ( which they won't allow to be uploaded online ) and our concern that it will be very difficult to remove a freeze with experian in the future ( there are many reports of this online ) we have not attempted this. Additionally when we attempted to upload documents for a fraud alert online, experian 's upload site simply times out. I have tried multiple times. Again, it seems that they intentionally make the process difficult. We have tried to call, but we were never able to reach a person to speak with. Credit agencies are required by law to allow for fraud alert and credit freezes to be placed. Experian seems to be doing their best to comply as little as possible with law.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I am facing a foreclosure sale date on XX/XX/XXXX. I have been trying for three years to get my mortgage lender Specialized Loan Servicing to work with me and provide information on the transfer of my loan to their company. My wife and I had this home built and have lived here over 20 years. We are both retired and on fixed incomes and have tried to get SLS to work with us. They have been difficult to deal with and have refused to provide me with requested information. After I got an Attorney involved to obtain an accounting and this information, they offered me a temporary modification, which I accepted and made the payments as agreed. However, when I received the paperwork to make this permanent, they had increased the payment almost {$700.00} a month to start, and it would keep going up over time. I was also shocked that there was a balloon payment of {$250000.00} added to the end of the loan?? My balance is only {$370000.00} and after 30 years of payments there would be an additional $ XXXX added? I asked for paperwork to back up the application of payments and accounting and this has not been provided and instead they have pushed me towards foreclosure. As mentioned, my wife and I have lived her 20 plus years. We bought the land, financed the construction and hoped to spend the rest of our days in this property. We have discovered some irregularities and inconsistencies in our mortgage paperwork and have requested on multiple occasions that SLS provide us with documentation, but we have been blocked at every turn. We were coerced into refinancing into a predatory loan while XXXX XXXX XXXX held the rights to our loan and the interest rate of 16.9 % was not affordable for us. This coincided with the recession and unemployment and my eventual retirement after 30 years with the postal service. We were eventually able to get a loan modification and get back on track. However, the loan was transferred to SLS on XX/XX/2015. At that time, I requested certain documentation relating to my loan payment history and documents from origination. I received a letter from them stating that this information had been sent to me, but that statement was false -- I never received this information. My wife and I are both retired and on fixed income. My sister stays with us as well and helps with the bills. We have sufficient income to afford a fair and reasonable loan modification. However, we are still requesting the information relating to the transfer of our account -- specifically 1. Copy of the promissory note 2. Copy of the Deed of Trust 3. Welcome letter from your company verifying the service transfer and the new role of SLS in the process 4. Escrow accounting and analysis 5. Payment history with transaction codes 6. Pay-off information 7. Signed modification paperwork from previous agreements 8. Copy of the Deed of Trust that has been transferred to SLS 9. Copy of the Pooling and Servicing agreement for SLS and investor We want to resolve this matter but need Specialized Loan Servicing to work with us.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/2018, my husband and I went to Pep Boys to buy eight new tires for our two vehicles because Pep Boys was having a promotion of buy two tires, get two free. Upon arrival at the store, there was also a promotional sign stating that if you applied for the Pep Boys credit card and were approved, you would get an additional 15 % off your purchase that day. The manager of the Pep Boys also informed us of the credit card promotion when payment was being discussed. My husband and I each applied for the credit card. Both of us were approved. I purchased the tires for my vehicle on my newly approved credit card and my husband purchased tires for his vehicle on his newly approved credit card. I asked the manager of the store how we would get the 15 % off the individual purchases and he informed me that the credit card company would take the 15 % off. About a month and a half later, after receiving the first statement on my credit card, I called the credit company that had issued the card from Pep Boys, Synchrony Bank, to ask how/when the 15 % off would be applied to the purchase. The representative at Synchrony Bank informed me that it could take up to 3 billing statements for the 15 % to be applied to purchase and to pay the minimum payment until i saw the statement credit applied. In the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX I still did not see the 15 % come off on either my husband or I 's statements for our credit cards. I then called Synchrony Bank again and a representative told me she did not know which promotion I was talking about and that there was no record of a promotion like what I was describing existing. The representative at that time suggested I call the Pep Boys store I made the purchase at to get more information about the promotion and to call back. I then called the Pep Boys I made the purchase at and the manager could not remember this credit card promotion either. I then went online and found the Pep Boys flyer from the time frame of my purchase ( https : //blackfriday.com/ads/black-friday/pep-boys/2 ) and realized that I was wrong about the promotion being 15 % because in the flyer it stated 10 % ( up to {$50.00} ) would be paid as a statement credit. I then called back Synchrony Bank and a representative informed me that in order to be eligible for the promotion I needed to have registered for the promotion by a certain date in XX/XX/2018 and the promotion only applied to purchases that were over {$490.00}. Even when i gave this representative the link to the above mentioned flyer, she told me that this was a Pep Boys promotion and had nothing to do with Synchrony Bank. This representative refused to give me any credit to my statement for the promotion.There is clearly either false advertising or a hidden requirement for this promotion. I never received any material in the mail or via email regarding the requirements the representative stated. I was also given conflicting information from representatives at Synchrony Bank from XX/XX/XXXXto XX/XX/XXXX.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..\n",

I gave well Fargo all the information need it, I demanded Wells Fargo to check the bank security camera where would easily show that I never been in this bank, the bank answered me that they did not have enough evidence that the transaction was unauthorized.The manager of the place where I used to live is a witness, he saw the person stealing from my home, my boyfriend is also witnessed, this person has many criminal records, there is a video in weel Fargo where will show this person on the bank, however for the bank conveniently all that is no enough evidence, so I wonder then what is enough evidence to Wells Fargo? Their decision was based only on assumption without any real proves of facts and they arrived to the conclusion that the transaction was made by me. They base their negligent decision in a poor investigation based in nothing factual, they told me because I live nearby the location from where the money was taken, and because my bank account was inflated the day before, and because there was no attempt of using other pins, the criminal was a friend of my roommate that spend some nigth at the house, my answer to all that : I was victim of robber by a person that my roommate used to trust that is not my fault, who he got my exact pin number I don't have idea, that is not my busyness, I did not give to him, I don't authorize him to go the bank, I did not plane to steal from myself.

      "VALUE OF S is In XXXX of XXXX, I had to get a root canal. At my dentist 's office, I was told about Synchrony Bank and something called CareCredit where I could get a loan to pay for this medical cost. At the time, I thought it a good idea because I was told by a representative of Synchrony Bank that it was a promotional finance loan where the first year of payments would be interest-free and any remaining balance after the initial twelve months, I would then be charged interest on that balance. I signed up for the service and the secretary at the dentist 's office printed the paperwork out for me. I took the paperwork home and looked it over. I then called Synchrony again to ask more about the loan. I was told a second time that the first year would be interest-free on any payments I made. This turned out to be partially true. While I did not pay any interest in the first year, because I carried a balance in XXXX of XXXX, the company than turned around and tacked on all the interest I did not pay over the year to my remaining balance. When I questioned them about this, they told me that it was clearly printed in the paperwork on each statement that deferred interest would come due if I did not pay the whole loan by the end of the year. I found their promotional deal deceptive for this reason, two different reps when explaining the details of the loan did not mention having to pay deferred interest, instead, they highlighted no interest for the first year and paying interest on what was left in the second year. I have looked over the paperwork, which I held onto. And while I can see now that it does indeed state that to avoid paying deferred interest payments, I must pay all of their promotional loan in full at the end of the 12 month period, no one took the time to make sure that I fully understood this. I do take responsibility for not looking over everything more carefully. My issue is with the way that this loan was advertised to me with important details verbally left out and giving me the impression that the product was one thing when in reality it was something else. At XXXX XXXX, for instance, when I took out a loan there, the banker took the time to explain all of the details and what they meant. If I had known, and I do take partial fault for this, but if I had realized the exact terms, I would have gone to XXXX XXXX where I could have gotten a much better interest rate. When I spoke to one of the managers at Synchrony Bank about this, I found her arrogant and patronizing. She also told me that how the employees at the bank explained the terms of the loan were not relevant to my situation and then she hung up on me.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I've been using XXXX XXXX online bill payment for roughly 8 years. I've never had an issue before where a biller claims to have not received a check processed through XXXX online bill payment until now. The biller in question is Upstart loan servicing. I arranged to have a {$130.00} check sent to Upstart on XX/XX/XXXX to satisfy an installment loan payment due. The payment was processed by XXXX with confirmation # XXXX, and the funds were deducted from my account. Upstart claimed to have not received the payment 10 days later and hit me with late fees. I contacted Upstart and XXXX about the issue. XXXX indicated the payment was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX suggested I put a stop payment on check because it had been more than 2 weeks since it had been mailed. I put a stop payment on the check. Upstart then claimed to have finally received the check on XX/XX/XXXX, a full 18 days after it was mailed, and then hit me with a stop payment fee. I made multiple attempts with both institutions to resolve this issue, including attending a conference call. Yet I somehow was unjustly punished for a processing error between these two institutions. But things only got worse ... Because of the aforementioned processing error, I mailed a second check to cover the first delayed one which was stopped. I arranged through XXXX online bill pay for that second check to be received by Upstart on XX/XX/XXXX. I received confirmation # XXXX for this second check, and the funds were deducted from my account. I have now been notified by Upstart that this second check has still not been received by XX/XX/XXXX, a full 11 days after it has been mailed. So for the second straight time, I'm being threatened with more late fees and reporting to the credit agencies because either XXXX isn't mailing these checks out on time or Upstart is not processing them in a timely manner. Either way, I'm the one being punished financially and through threats to ruin my credit because these big financial institutions are having processing issues. I've done everything asked of me. I sent these checks on time to meet due dates. I've had more than sufficient funds in my account to cover these checks. I've contacted each of these institutions many times to rectify these issues. Yet I'm at their mercy. Upstart claims they are receiving checks a full 18 days after they are mailed to them. I've never heard of such a thing. And now they claim that the second check still hasn't been received after a full 11 days of mailing time. XXXX claims they are sending these checks on time. Each blames the other. But I'm the one getting hit with fees and negative credit reporting for something I am not responsible for. Upstart can continue hitting me with fees and hurting my credit and there's seemingly nothing I can do about it. This is unjust and likely illegal. I need someone to protect my rights as a consumer. I'm being taken advantage of. I'm going to my U.S. Congressman and Senator with this complaint. I shouldn't be abused like this.\n",

Facts : XXXX XXXX XXXX. Has used predatory collection tactics, against me to obtain default judgements and then force payments. They have used the legal system to threaten, and they act like they were doing me a favor by offering me a reduced payment on me to pay for 2 credit cards with XXXX that had already been charge off accounts by XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I did not know any better and just gave them a pre authorized check that I honestly thought I was curing my last credit cards that had gone bad due to unemployment. But I believed them and I thought this was better then filing bankruptcy and I even have letter that shows they were settled. In XXXX I received a call about new default judgement and I hit the roof. I wrote to them and disputed the charges. Yet to no avail. I have disputed the debt but they know the people in the court so this time I was at my worse financially. I did not think they would obtain anything, because sadly I have been financially insolvent, barely making enough to pay rent, food even with food stamps, student status because I could not get any jobs due to the judgements against me, coupled with anxiety and could not get over so much loss/crisis. Yet this company is thriving by abusing families, they got a default judgement without properly notifying me or PROVIDING PROOF OF THE DEBT. They have lawyers, clerks and people working the system. They act with no regard or fear of being checked, because they know I don't even have the money to pay for a lawyer or the filing fee. This is a disgrace, that I go to the court and I can't do anything. Today I thought I would reach out to your group in hopes for justice. Here are the details : Case XXXX Vs. XXXX XXXX Original Creditor is Citibank-XXXX : ending XXXX Acct opened XXXX Date Account Charged off : XX/XX/XXXX Default Judgement : {$2500.00} On XX/XX/XXXX I requested SUBSTANTIATION PROOF OF DEBT received no response from them. On XX/XX/XXXX. I Received a ( NOTICE OF LEVY- ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGEMENT ) copy of a recently court filing form XXXX of the same judgement but now it is for $ XXXX-READS notice of Execution of Money File XXXX-original court case XXXX. They know I live in XXXX, they have my address because it arrived. Yet they Filed in XXXX Courthouse South East District. with signed levying officers listed as County Sheriff Civil Division XXXX by XXXX XXXX of XXXX county XXXX # XXXX registered process server. I made the mistake of paying them for two credit cards, XXXX XXXX, that went into charge off status due to loss of employment, loss foreclosure of my home in XXXX in XXXX. At that point, I was doing my best to settle things with creditors because I was in financial crisis. I wrote to all my creditors ( attached letters ) directly and paid the credit cards I owed by making direct settlements with credit cards companies. I also did a Died in Lieu of Foreclosure with XXXX XXXX XXXX, they agreed to charge off the $ XXXX..first loan, {$53000.00} for second loan and one final remaining credit card with Citibank, it is noted on my credit report ( see recent credit report attached ). They consequently denied this agreement and turned it into a foreclosure but gave me charge offs on all the debt due to the HARP guidelines. My credit was ruined, XXXX XXXX filed a Judgement and I paid, XXXX XXXX found a way to squeeze out {$2000.00} out of my promising that they would not file judgements against me, they claimed they had been hired by my credit card companies. I did not know any better so I paid them. ( I can provide checks once I get from bank ). I wrote letters to XXXX XXXX XXXX, to get my final relocation {$1500.00} but no luck. I was stuck in a rural area now, no job and in XXXX when they sent me a letter to pay the above credit debt, I demanded proof. I had after all lost my dignity, job, all my 401k, filed for unemployment, forced to apply for welfare to survive. I did not think moving to northern XXXX with {$1500.00} of the original deal to keep only one house would have been possible ; but a Lawyer from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX assisted me. I tried to apply for similar jobs, and could not obtain employment, filed for Welfare, became financially insolvent, have lost everything and have no money for anyone to levy ; not even me. I have been working for the last XXXX years barely providing basic needs for my XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ; I have gotten divorce and on XX/XX/XXXX I received a copy of a \" Money Levy from XXXX XXXX.

As I had suspected, I settled two of the credit cards with them for XXXX and XXXX again two different credit cards. They now want to squeeze more blood, but there is nothing left. They have gone out and purchased some OLD CHARGED OFF debt from CITI Bank after they promised that they would not file DEROGATORY legal judgements against me.

This is unfair and they deserve to be held accountable by someone. I do not owe XXXX XXXX or have a credit card contract with their client Citibank/XXXX. They were not able to validate the debt, and when I refused to be taken advantage again, because my credit was still showing all those judgements plus a foreclosure, they decided to pay the courts to obtain a default judgement in XXXX Both cities that they have contacts, with the people there facilitate their paper filings. In addition, I have called them and disputed these charges repeatedly over the phone, in writing but they will not stop filing more forms with the court, harrasing me, using the courts to bring a judgement on a debt they have no proof I owe them. I have copies of the settlement letters from them, I went into default on my credit cards, and later experienced more financial hardship ; I took responsibility for my wrongs. I have paid my DEBTS, it has been XXXX years of ABSOLUTE XXXX, crisis and this company is ruthless they will not leave me alone. They deserve to be fined themselves for the tactics they use with the courts to obtain wage garnishments for debt that has been charged off. I request that they be investigated, prosecuted themselves because I have no powe4r against them. I went to my local court and asked them for help on this and have tried to go to the XXXX Court House Self help but they say I need to go to XXXX XXXX which is 12 hours south of here. This is EGREGIOUS behavior! Moreover, I pulled my credit report as a result of this and during the time period they claim this debt is from is too old. It is not listed as one of my accounts. I also have copies of the settlement letters I wrote to ( my creditors see attached ). I have also kept copies of the letters that XXXX sent me with copies of credit cards that had already gone to judgement but they told me they ha settled accounts I had with them. They obviously had my address, contact but they failed to communicate because they knew they had the judgement, which was easier then to verify the debt because they do not have a way to pull the original contract. I know I have made some mistakes dealing with credit, but did the best given my situation to settle and make workouts. Life happens to all of us. I am not a crook. It has been years of trying very hard to survive, living below poverty level, using free, donated items, getting XXXX health, and now after XXXX years this company is coming to garnish my wages because they were given a default judgement with no proof of the debt. This is unfair and I implore you do something about this this company, they are a cancer, they need to be investigated and stopped. How can they get these default judgements, abuse working citizens and make money? Who are they paying to process these documents without proof of the these old charged off debt?

I contacted both XXXX and XXXX who both found NO negative or derogatory information within my reports ( no public records, no collections, excellent credit-debt ratio, only three inquiries with two being old ). I had to pay {$12.00} to purchase a membership so that the agent at XXXX could review my report. Emailed Experian on XX/XX/19 @ XXXX stating these findings and attached all three credit bureau reports. Specifically requested Experian to point out the derogatory information they stated in their last email. Received email response from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/19 @ XXXX : \" This issue was escalated to the appropriate department and worked. It was determined that the Score Factors presented are accurate and based on the information contained in your credit file. Please review a hard copy of your report to locate and confirm the derogatory information. '' Called Experian on XX/XX/19 @ XXXX. Agent pulled up ticket number and reviewed report. No negative or derogatory findings. Was disconnected when trying to transfer to supervisor. Called again @ XXXX. Membership agent said he could not find previously referenced ticket ( closed ), but would open another ticket and that I should send email again with screenshots ASAP ; asked to speak to supervisor due to prior issues with emailing Experian. Talked with supervisor XXXX who pulled and reviewed my report and confirmed that there are no negative factors or derogatory information contained within my credit report. Stated that there are two systems at Experian : a system that actually generates the credit report, and a membership system that generates another. She reviewed both and can find no negative or derogatory information in either system. Rather than creating another ticket ( stated that she can see my emails and the attachments Ive already sent ), she is going to talk with XXXX XXXX tomorrow morning ( agent assigned to latest case ) and ask why he closed the case prematurely. She will have XXXX XXXX call me ( cell number given ) by tomorrow afternoon to discuss the case and what will happen moving forward. As you can see, I've been stuck in an endless loop of insanity since XX/XX/XXXX. After being on hold for 5-20 minutes waiting for an agent every time I have to call Experian, I then have to re-explain my issue. At first, I'd get shuffled around each department, again retelling my story every time, only to be told \" we can't help you with that here. '' Now, I just immediately ask to speak with a supervisor who within a few minutes understands my problem. I then immediately email them with the information they have requested, and the random agent that gets assigned to my email always sends me a canned response that shows they have not read my case notes or bothered to look at the attached credit report or screen shots demonstrating the problem. They close my case and I start all over again. There is obviously a problem with Experian 's system in how it is interpreting my credit report. They tell me that my issue is not affecting my FICO score, yet my score dropped from 800+ ( where it should be given my excellent credit history ) to XXXX when I first noticed this problem, and it has not budged from XXXX since that time. I am beyond frustrated and have spent countless hours trying to fix a problem that I did not create. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n",

Now mind you I've had accounts removed for early exclusion before. And, she stated it can be done but it wasn't an option now, so when I asked her when would be the right time she kept stating XX/XX/20. That isn't early exclusion. Even if she told me, hey no guarantees but try XX/XX/XXXX or late, would've been more help. But her constant rude and belittling responses, failure to give me any additional info is appalling. Experian really should spend more time training their staff, especially the supervisors because XXXX was a jerk! Not to mention, early exclusion is a thing. Experian is the only credit reporting agency who is still reporting this negative account. XXXX and XXXX removed it almost 6 months ago because the account was completely inaccurate. Experian always has the most issues with reporting accurate information. They really should be shut down.\n",

The apartment complex, XXXX XXXX XXXX, located in XXXX, Arizona did not send me written correspondence outlining the fee that was owed. In the move out notice it explained that the fees would be processed and mailed to the forwarding address on file once I moved out. I was waiting for this to be mailed to either myself or my mom as she was the cosigner. Since we received no correspondence in the mail, I expected no further charges were due. In XXXX I received two automated voicemails claiming to be a debt collection agency and that it was an attempt to collect debt. Two more voicemails were left in XXXX. I have been waiting for mail correspondence from the debt collectors as they must contact me in writing within five days of contacting me. Recently I was going though my voicemails and decided to give the number a call back. They had barely any account information only that it was from XXXX XXXX XXXX and it was in my name. They were unable to accept payment and told me I had to email someone to obtain further information. They told me that in order to find out more information Mr. XXXX at ProCollect needed to take the restriction off the account. ProCollect -- the debt agency -- has not contacted me in writing nor is willing to cooperate over the phone regarding money owed. I ask for this company to prove that I owe money -- in writing -- and provide a secure means for me to pay the balance.

      "VALUE OF S is In XXXX of XXXX I made arrangements with Synchrony Bank to settle a credit card debt on my Sam 's Club credit card. The amount that was agreed upon was {$6300.00}. The terms of the agreement as I was told was that I had one year to pay that amount or it would go into default. At no time was I told to make a payment every month, only to pay it off within one year. I asked for the terms to be emailed or mailed to me in a letter and their representative said they don't do that. He said that I would only get a letter from them when the settlement was paid in full. I made my first payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$2500.00}. I made another payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$3000.00}. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to make the final payment of {$890.00} and was told that the account was in default and they could not accept my payment because I did not make a payment every month. I asked them why it went into default after I made the payment in XX/XX/XXXX instead of sooner when I hadn't made a payment for almost 7 months after the first payment. They would not tell me. They just said I didn't comply with the terms. At no time did I receive anything in writing stating I was in default from Synchrony or the terms of my settlement agreement even though I had asked for it. I don't believe I am in the wrong here due to their refusal to send me anything in writing. I am fully prepared to pay them the agreed upon balance of {$890.00} but not the {$7000.00} they say I must pay.

As of todays date, I have not received any adjustments on my account for the fraudulent charges, any of the 6 fees associated with the charges, and three of my checks have each been returned due to the banks failure to adjust the charges. US Bank advised me that they would take as long as 10 business days to adjust the charges on the account, basically leaving customers with no ability to recover their funds sooner. The bank should not expect customers to cover negative balances and fees caused by unauthorized charges. Most disturbingly, however, is the fact that when I deposited a check into my account on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 to cover the fraudulent transactions, my check was adjusted from my account because the name on the check was slightly misspelled from my name.

I uploaded all the required documents to the MY LOANS online portal on beginning XX/XX/XXXX and sending in my last documents on XX/XX/XXXX. I received approval and a trial payment agreement that I signed and uploaded to XX/XX/XXXX before the deadline of XX/XX/XXXX. The trial payments began on XX/XX/XXXX and I made all 4 monthly payments with the final payment paid on XX/XX/XXXX on time. I began receiving collection phone calls in late XX/XX/XXXX and over 10 letters some certified mail saying that I owed over 5,000 dollars. I called the first time and was told that was just due to the home modification process. I received a notice early XX/XX/XXXX that my credit score dropped 100 points and I called back in, this is when I was told my modification had been cancelled on XX/XX/XXXX due to my trial agreement paperwork not being returned. I notified the phone agent XXXX that I had in fact uploaded the paperwork XX/XX/XXXX and she called me back to inform me that my case would be reopened and I would receive final modification paperwork within 15 days. I never received the paperwork and over the course of XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX twice, XXXX twice who promised to call me back both times and never did, XXXX who gave me unsolicited and incorrect loan counselling advice, and a few other people who did not help. I had been told 3 times that my case was reopened and with underwriting once by XXXX and twice by XXXX before XX/XX/XXXX when I demanded to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor XXXX spoke with me on XX/XX/XXXX and told me that my case had not been reopened and that the ball has been dropped and my case was still closed meaning my credit was being falsely damaged due to this companiys negligence. I feel that this is some type of ploy to get me to fall delinquent on my loan so Flagstar can foreclose and take possession of my home or possibly an attempt to cause me to owe more than the 1 month pass due balance of XXXX because the current amount I owe is XXXX because of my case being closed in error putting me 2 additional months behind. I finally received my final modification documents XX/XX/XXXX and the capitalized amount is XXXX which is incorrect because my modification was cancelled back in XX/XX/XXXX due to Flagstars error. I am currently seeking legal advice and I have reached out on online forums to see if any other Flagstar customers have experienced this type of issue. The treatment I have received since my mortgage was transferred to Flagstar is unacceptable and unethical and the ball has been dropped will not suffice as an explanation.\n",

Please help me get my car back. I've invested so much time, energy and money. They've been bullying me from the beginning, convincing me to do the voluntary repossession and setting it up for auction very quickly afterwards. Twice.

      "VALUE OF S is I previously submit a complaint about my early lease termination with XXXX XXXX XXXX. My complaint seemed to be resolved and I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that I basically do not have anything else they can possible bill me for. On XX/XX/XXXX, I had a XXXX dealership contact Kia finance to get my remaining payoff balance. My salesman asked Kia Finance for ALL fees, all balances so that way it can be rolled into my new XXXX lease. They gave them a pay off balance of {$2600.00}. XXXX paid that balance. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I received a bill in the mail for {$360.00} from Kia finance. I called Kia Finance and they told me my remaining balance was {$3000.00} so I am paying the difference of {$360.00}. XXXX specifically asked for ALL fees, ALL remaining balances so why am I stuck with an early termination fee? After contacting Kia finance, this was not resolved and I was told it would be easier to discuss the fee with my XXXX salesman. I called my salesman at XXXX and he had no problem calling Kia to sort this issue out as I should not have ANY bill from Kia finance. Thankfully, Kia finance records calls for quality assurance but when requested by my XXXX salesman for the call to be pulled to show Kia finance that he specifically asked for ALL FEES AND ALL BALANCES, Kia finance said they are not able to pull the call but a manager can do a manager will be in contact with one of us. I have not received a phone call. My salesman has not received a phone call. To my knowledge, I still have a {$360.00} bill from Kia that I absolutely will not pay until that phone call is pulled for proof that they were supposed to give this balance to XXXX. I can not believe the amount of XXXX I have had to deal with during my first lease with Kia. My salesman from XXXX is completely baffled at this company. The only way this will be resolved is if Kia pulls that call and hears that my XXXX salesman asked for all balances and Kia did not provide him with this random fee. Im not paying it and neither is XXXX so hopefully Kia finance can figure it out amongst themselves.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is This situation started about a year ago when I noticed that Experian was not showing my XXXX XXXX credit card reporting information and my credit score had dropped. I quickly notified Experian and submitted a Dispute along with my incorrect Birth Date. The birth date was corrected after numerous submissions of disputes. However, the reporting of my XXXX XXXX account was not. I spoke to a lady at Experian and she stated that I had to contact XXXX XXXX and have them submit a re-instatement form. I immediately did contact CardServices at XXXX XXXX and the representative stated that they always submit my reporting to all three agencies. I explained to her that Experian is not getting them and if they would please help me. She again stated that I had to contact Experian, but also gave me an address for XXXX XXXX Consumer Recovery Depart. ( see Attached ), I followed up by sending them a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX, for which I have not received an answer. I also send another dispute to Experian on XX/XX/XXXX. So now I am being bounced from Experian to XXXX XXXX and no one will assume responsibility to fix the situation of just simply reporting my XXXX credit card payment history. I have no problem with XXXX or XXXX, they report accurately. On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received a letter from Experian stating that my dispute under report # XXXX was completed and to my surprise, they stated that the reinvestigation results indicate that the \" Item Disputed are NOT currently Displaying on your Personal Credit Report \" and that I have to submit a dispute so they can send it to XX/XX/ .. I am being bounced again and really need your help and guidance.\n",

This is my ex-husband. We were divorced XX/XX/XXXX. There were no mutual debts at the time of our divorce. I even informed them that I heard from a friend of his, that he died sometime in XXXX. I requested that this company please remove my phone number from their records. To date, they have not done this because I received a call, again, looking for XXXX XXXX.

Ms. XXXX confirmed that she issued a full refund on XX/XX/18 and had placed the refund check in the mail. She also provided a copy of the check as proof. After 9 business days of not receiving the refund, I followed up with Ms. XXXX. No phone calls returned and only emails from an assistant by the name of \" XXXX ''.

      "VALUE OF S is I have been with Pacific Western Bank, or the banks it acquired, for 24 years. I have both my personal and business accounts in the XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX XXXX. My company also uses the XXXX branch for our deposits from our XXXX office. With few exceptions the relationship with PWB has been symbiotic and professional until recently. As it stands now, a PWB manager is engaging in practices that are putting my business at risk and causing vendors and employees to go unpaid. Roughly a month and a half ago, XXXX XXXX, manager of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, began placing holds on our deposits. In some instances she would place a hold on only one of several checks deposited. In other instances she would place a hold on all checks deposited. The holds would be placed without her having reviewed the checks in person and without any personal knowledge of who the check issuers were or the amounts of specific checks. In two instances, at least, she placed 7-10 day holds on cashier 's checks from known depositors with whom we bank with weekly. As far as I can recollect, this year there has only been one instance where a check was returned to PWB from one of our client 's issuing banks for NSF. There was also only one instance of a check being returned due to a stop payment being issued. Those two instances were apparently the trigger for the scrutiny that XXXX XXXX is now indiscriminately wielding on all deposits. When I have inquired as to why she is doing this, her responses, the few times she answers my calls or emails, can be summarized as she must protect the interest of the bank and it's employees. How can that be done when she is single-handedly putting one of it's longest standing business clients out of business? As it stands today, she has over $ XXXX of my deposits on hold. As a result none of my employees were paid last week and remain unpaid, our primary vendor also remains unpaid, and I am spending more time and energy responding to her decisions to hold our money than I do responding to the needs of my employees during this difficult time. It is unconscionable that a company that is continually making deposits and capable of paying it's employees, albeit difficult, is unable to do so because it's bank manager has chosen to hold all it's deposits while the federal government is giving away billions to avoid this very issue. I am requesting all holds be removed from my deposits and that my accounts be transferred to a different branch with a different manager,\n",

I was told by Experian to contact XXXX XXXX when I noticed information on my credit file that was fraudulent.

      "VALUE OF S is Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance.

Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full.

I have reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX in reference to this collection and they still haven't provide me with the requested documentation that VALIDATES this debt properly. This is not my debt and I am requesting that it is removed immediately. This collection is harming my credit report and it is violating my HIPPA Rights. Please be advised that this is my SECOND WRITTEN REQUEST asking you to remove the unverified accounts listed below that remain on my credit report in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681. You are required under the FCRA to have properly verified the accuracy of an account listed on my credit report. In the results of your first re-investigation, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly. Where are the documents that you used to verify these accounts? What is the name of the person in your company who verified these accounts? What documents did they use to verify them? Please provide me with the name of that individual, their business address, and telephone number. Blacks Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, 2009, defines Verify as, 1 ) \" To prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate. '' 2 ) to confirm or substantiate by oath or affidavit ; to swear to the truth of. '' and Verification as, Confirmation of correctness, truth or authenticity, by affidavit, oath, or deposition. Affidavit of truth of a matter stated and object of verification is to assure good faith in averments or statements of a party. What this means is that your company must be willing and able to produce a document in your files that proves the account ( s ) in dispute belong to me and the information being reported is accurate and you must be able to do this in a court of law if I file a lawsuit against you. Someone in your company must authenticate the documents in your files that were used to verify the disputed accounts and to do this they must have 1st hand knowledge of the alleged account ( s ) and all that has ever transpired for the alleged account ( s ), under oath and under the penalty of perjury. As I am sure that you are well aware, current Federal case law states that, Consumer Reporting Agencies bear grave responsibilities to ensure the accuracy of the accounts they report on and their responsibility must consist of something more than merely parroting information received from other sources. The Courts have also ordered that a Reinvestigation that merely shifts the burden back to the consumer and the credit grantor can not fulfill the obligations imposed by 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ). You have ignored my request to provided me with the documents that you have in your files that you used to verify the disputed accounts which means that you have NOT verified or you can not verify any of these accounts and under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me for negligent noncompliance ( Section 617 ) if you fail to comply with this Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA. I demand the following accounts be verified or deleted immediately. 1.

      "VALUE OF S is Loan Care is servicing the loan which we fell behind on and we have been trying to get our short sale approved since XXXX. My agent says they don't know the process, they are asking her for things that are not legal, and now that the appraisal has been done and our offer is meeting the net, they will not send an approval. The underwriter 's name is XXXX, she will not return my agent 's calls. The supervisor we have been dealing with is named XXXX, he just continues to say that she will call us, but we have been in this loop for weeks.

I requested documentation of proof of the accounts referenced in the letter to be validated and that the collection agencies, XXXX, any third party or court provide me documents of the alleged collections or public record accounts. And, that E-oscar is unacceptable for verification. However, I have not received any response at all from XXXX and I have not received any information from anyone to verify these accounts. I have exhausted my pro-bono abilities and obviously can not resolve these matters without legal representation. I have disputed and requested actual verification several times and I am demanding immediate removal of these disputed items. Or, I will be acquiring an attorney to represent me in these violations of the FCRA.\n",

I am not able to see current data for today only past statements. The on line chat with a representative was listed as unavailable. When I dial the telephone number of XXXX I receive a message that the number is not in service.

      "VALUE OF S is TransUnion is maliciously, recklessly and purposefully reporting an unauthorized hard inquiry by XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. First of all I commend XXXX XXXX for doing such a thorough investigation once I made them aware of this situation. Although I have requested an investigation numerous times from TransUnion and also complained with the CFPB about the inaccurate hard inquiry reporting by TransUnion regarding this inquiry, TransUnion purposely continues to report it unauthorized, even after I informed them that I was a victim of several data breaches. This is Malicious and Reckless on their part. TransUnion lied about their investigation because XXXX XXXX stated in the letter enclosed in this Complaint that they NEVER received a dispute by TransUnion. TransUnion not only lied, but did not perform a reasonable investigation into this issue. TransUnion enabled me to be a victim of identity theft. XXXX XXXX has requested TransUnion to delete this hard inquiry since XX/XX/XXXX but TransUnion has yet to comply. TransUnion needs to immediately remove this hard inquiry from XXXX XXXX from my credit file immediately!\n",
      "VALUE OF S is My wife and I closed on our mortgage XX/XX/XXXX with Ditech and worked with customer loan processor XXXX XXXX and senior home loan specialist XXXX XXXX. Our first payment due started XX/XX/XXXX at {$930.00}. Five payments were made to Ditech on XX/XX/XXXX for {$930.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX Due date ), XX/XX/XXXX for {$940.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX due date ), XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX due date ), XX/XX/XXXX for {$950.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX due date ) and XX/XX/XXXX for {$950.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX due date ). On a letter from Ditech dated XX/XX/XXXX we were notified that our loan would be transferring to XXXX XXXX XXXX d/b/a XXXX XXXX. The letter included the statement The servicing of your mortgage account is being transferred, effective with your payment due XX/XX/XXXX. It also stated All payments made on or after XX/XX/XXXX should be sent to XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I lost my job but was able to pay our XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. We received our first statement around XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX stating amount due of {$1800.00} which was including an overdue payment. I called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they said not to worry that Ditech would be forwarding payments to XXXX XXXX and to allow 60 days for this to happen. Each statement we received from XXXX XXXX included the past due payment along with late fees. Around XX/XX/XXXX I called customer service and they said to send supporting information as to the XX/XX/XXXX payment and they would research it. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent them information from my bank showing the payment had debited my account. After no response I called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX again and spoke with XXXX XXXX who replied via email that I will be your single point of contact until a resolution is found. I sent her 4 emails between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX along with 3 calls and did not get a reply. On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed XXXX XXXX customer service, XXXX XXXX and copied Ditechs XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and explained the situation and also included my banks stamped copies of my bank statements. XXXX XXXX did reach out and forwarded my email to XXXX customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and I also included a proof of payment statement from my bank. To date there has been no reply via email, phone or mail from Ditech. Even when I was unemployed for 8 weeks I have continued to pay my mortgage and even payed over the minimum to Ditech and XXXX XXXX. This has been very stressful for my wife and I and we do not feel that we should be bearing the brunt of accounting lapses. We have tried to communicate as respectfully as we can during the past 4 months and neither institution seems to care about the {$950.00} payment we made. Every month we continue to get late notices, phone calls and text messages about the alleged missed payment. We dont have money and do not plan to make a double payment and we hope that you can further look into this matter since we dont seem to have any pull.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Barclay 's Arrival Plus had a promotion of a sign-up bonus for XXXX miles if you spend at least {$5000.00} within the first 90 days after opening. On XX/XX/2019 I was approved. I had until XX/XX/2019 to spend {$5000.00}. Twice before the due date I called Barclay 's customer service confirming the date and the amount I have left to spend. Both customer representatives also referred me to check my account online on a tool called \" Spend Analyzer '' to determine how much I spent up to that point. This tool is inaccurate. It includes credit card fees that aren't counted toward to {$5000.00} requirement, but I wasn't informed that nor were the customer service representatives aware. After my 90 days passed, I fully expected to receive my bonus. I called customer service and they said I didn't meet the requirement. I thought this was a miscalculation on their part because I downloaded my statement and it showed I was over the {$5000.00} and matched the Spend Analyzer. I opened a case so they can review if I spent enough. It wasn't until later that if I removed the fees, my calculation matched the customer rep. But the company never contacted me back after they closed my case. I called again and spoke to a customer service manager. This time reporting that their tool was misleading and that I would absolutely have spent the $ XXXX I was short to earn {$700.00} in rewards if I had known the true calculation. Who wouldn't spend {$15.00} more if it meant {$700.00} back? They opened a new case. I was still not rewarded the bonus nor did they contact me back.\n",

The FDIC standard is of course 120 days, unless the account is sold at full value. Accordingly, the XXXX account was sold off to a debt buying agency at full value. Accordingly, XXXX XXXX - XXXX has reported the account as a permanent charge off ststus, which does not apply to debt purchases to a third-party, See Henson v. Santander Consumer Financial USA , Inc.

I have my student loan payment garnished from my check in the amount of 15 % every payday. I tried contacting the US Department of Education and they said my loans are with the collection agency named XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called them today XX/XX/19 and spoke to XXXX on a recorded line. He said that I am going to remain in default until my loans are paid in full and they are not required to report to credit bureaus. He said my payment is not considered voluntary and therefore my status will not change. I was told I could only come out of a default status by letting the garnishment continue and making a separate payment to them. That is absurd. A payment whether voluntary or involuntary is still a payment being received. He also stated that I have a balance of {$130000.00} and on the US Department of Education student loan website my balance is {$110000.00}. How can I make a payment and owe collection fees that high?

After several dispute they still have the accounts as open and collections without any prove. I asked for prove and they sent me a summary of monthly data of reports that was sent by these companies ( collections ). It is clear that these 3 credit bureaus are working for other companies and collections companies to put false information and false accounts into consumers like myself, to use their power to make me as a bad credit consumer. And what that means is that I will be force to pay for something that I have no knowledge of, to be able to get approved for any purchase of a car, a home and etc. They have refused to investigate, they have not sent me any prove, they have not deleted the fraudulent accounts and am asking for the intervention.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is On XX/XX/XXXX, the mortgage company informed me that my mortgage was in foreclosure status and I had to pay the full past due amount of {$9500.00} via XXXX XXXX to keep my account from being assigned an attorney. On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid {$9500.00} via XXXX XXXX. The payments were broken down into three payments {$4000.00} - {$1500.00} - {$4000.00}. I had to break them up because XXXX XXXX will only allow you to send a specific amount at one time. All of the payments were sent on the same day. I called the mortgage company from XXXX XXXX and provided them with the tracking numbers. This should have made my mortgage current with my next payment due in XX/XX/XXXX. I called the mortgage company about a week and a half later because I did not see my account updated in full ( missing {$4000.00} ). The mortgage company stated they needed to do research on the payment in order to locate it. I have called almost every other week looking for a resolution. The mortgage company has told me on at least three occasions that they were going to initiate a new research on the payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, I inquired as to why it's taking so long to update my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, the mortgage company stated they were waiting for me to send in receipts. However, no one ever asked me for receipts. I then hung up the telephone with the bank and immediately faxed all of the receipts. I followed up with a telephone call the next week to inquire about the status. I was told they received the receipts but again that they needed to research it. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that the research was completed but the money was not located. I then questioned the whereabouts of my {$4000.00}. I was told they were going to research the payment again. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that my {$4000.00} was sent back to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and my account is still behind. XXXX XXXX informed me that the {$4000.00} check they sent to the mortgage company was cashed and they do not have a record of the monies being returned. Concerns : Only two of the three payments were posted in XX/XX/XXXX although all three payments were made together. The mortgage company cashed the check with the missing {$4000.00} Why would the mortgage company send the money back on XX/XX/XXXX instead of posting it to my account Why would the mortgage company continue to say they couldn't locate the funds when in fact they cashed the check. How can they send my mortgage back into foreclosure status when I paid the money as agreed. This is still unresolved almost four months later, my {$4000.00} is missing and they have stopped applying payments to my mortgage. I'm concerned about sending them more money.\n",

For some reason, I realized that there was a late payment on my credit report, I called CBNA and they said their system mistakenly put me on paperless billing, which I did not request, and it caused my 30 day late.

      "VALUE OF S is I bought a {$2000.00} XXXX XXXX coupon in XX/XX/XXXX. On my first visit to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was charged to my Walmart/Synchrony Bank Mastercard the amount of {$1700.00}. The XXXX XXXX company was sent a claim for {$420.00} the same day. On XX/XX/XXXX a XXXX claim was sent in for {$1800.00}. I could never get anyone from the company to give me any clue as to why these types of charges were going through as they also charged me about {$620.00} to my XXXX XXXX account and never reported to insurance but after a couple months of complaining, they did reverse that charge. My {$2000.00} credit never seemed to get applied and in XX/XX/XXXX I was sent an email from a new employee that the doctor would not redo the start of the XXXX, as the XXXX XXXX that is XXXX into XXXX fell into my mouth at home a few days later so both the Office Manager and the Doctor said they would redo the XXXX for free. Later they decided to arbitrarily drop me as a patient, did not do any of the XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. He would only accept EMERGENCY care for the next 30 days. So, basically, I had paid {$1700.00} and received no valid services. I thought the ordeal was over but on XX/XX/XXXX a REBILL showed up on my Mastercard/SynchronyBank card for {$1700.00} again. This is an unauthorized and fraudulent transaction that Synchrony Bank has refused to remove. I have now been assigned a Special Agent for Law Enforcement for the State of North Carolina to investigate for Insurance Fraud and other criminal activities as well. Almost on a daily basis after escalating a Customer Service call four times to get to management that some of my information did not get uploaded properly the first time I disputed the XXXX charge, so I had to start over. Almost on a daily basis I sent further PROOF to Synchrony Bank. Their last letter to me from Synchrony Bank told me I had not shown 'proof of return '. I returned a fax to them that I had no idea what they meant. They also stated I could sent in additional information but gave no idea of what they needed. On almost a daily basis you can see from the secure messages, that I sent several letters a day with attachments of agreements, forms, proof of charges, proof of {$2000.00} credit XXXX coupon I had purchased. Told them the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX never sent me a statement, yet the agreement called for two statements a month. The Synchrony Bank manager I spoke with said that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent in over 15 pages of information to support their charges but I have been unable to get copies from the bank or the dental office. I did ask her to look at the proof and see if she noticed a notation that work could not be done unless authorized by me as they were attempting to get me to sign a one year plan of attack on my dental work for {$30000.00}. They said I had to sign the document to get any work done but I told them I could never spend that amount and I would notate on each page, which as fairly thick that authorization had to be obtained before continuing.

In XX/XX/XXXX I received new orders and began the move out process, I gave them a hard copy of my orders and had email traffic ( at the time ) with the manager at the time named XXXX. He examined my apartment and told me to have the carpets cleaned. He gave me the phone number for the company they use and I paid almost {$200.00} for the carpets to be cleaned. The day I moved out I was told to leave the keys on the counter and lock the door behind me. I emailed him and called him afterwards trying to figure out if all was good and if I owed anything more. He never got back with me, so I took that as an understanding that all was okay. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the current manager that replaced XXXX saying that I owed a debt, I informed her of the situation and she confirmed she saw the email traffic. I let her know that I would only speak to corporate and to refer me immediately. After unanswered calls and emails, I again thought all was taken care of and sorted out. I then just received a letter in the mail dated XX/XX/XXXX saying I owed even more. I am so confused, I called the collection agency and they threatened my credit, yelled out me, berated me, and told me that if I didnt pay today it would noted as a refusal and they would report me. They told me I could take a payment plan, but that the plan would only be available today. They then began to tell me they accept Visa and MasterCard. I have tried countless times to get in touch with the Apartment Complex, none of these charges are warranted. I have not lived in that apartment complex for almost a year and half. They have had my contact information this entire time. The Collection Agency is called ProCollect and I believe it to be a scam.

This caused my Citi Costco Credit Card to be cancelled through no fault of my own. I have contacted both Citi and XXXX and they have both acknowledged that my account should be active and that the Costco Credit Card should still be open as well. Citi initially offered to attempt to re-open my account pending a Hard Credit Card Pull and I declined that authorization as my account should not have been closed in the first place.

      "VALUE OF S is I have been working with Roundpoint to complete a loan mod due to an increase of over 300.00 due to an escrow analysis that took place less than a year after my loan was originated. Since I started with the loan mod process, I continue to be advise that once certain documents are received it will move to the approval process. However, there are always additional documents requested which were not advised when I previously spoke with the associate who advised what documents are needed. It takes then 4 days to review documents faxed in and then take them another 4 to 5 days to review the file just to inform you that more documents are needed. One one occasion, I actually emailed the documents to a represented, who stated that she did not receive the documents. I have attempted to do my part to decrease my escrow shortage by finding a lower insurance premium and filing homestead. I was advised by a representative XXXX not to request an additional escrow analysis at this point being that the loan mod will revaluate by escrow. In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX ( SPC ) and he advised that if I could continue to make 1 payment a month while in the Loan Mod process then my loan will not be placed in Foreclosure and I have continue to do that monthly even though it has been difficult. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to schedule a monthly payment and the associate advised that they can not accept less than 2 payment as my loan is 3 month behind. I told her that I could not afford 2 payments. She stated that due to a new process that she could not accept more than 2 payments. I advised if this was a investor guideline and needed further information as I felt that Roundpoint was not trying to work with me an was trying to make my house away from me and my family. She agreed to take one payment. I called back today XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with my SPC XXXX to find out further details about this new process. He told me that the payment will probably not be accepted since I have the hold on my account and that the associate should not have taken the payment. He could not provide an details on it other then telling me that 1 payment really wasn't resolving anything and was just a circle that I was required to make two payments to decrease the default on the loan. I was totally devastated by his comment. I asked to speak with a manager to understand this \" new policy ''. The manager refused to take my call as he was busy on another call. XXXX informed me that the manager advised since my loan was transferring to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, they may take my payment. A mortgage payment that will not make a payment and my loan is not in foreclosure? I have never heard of this type of procedure and no one can provide the details associated with it. Roundpoint has done nothing to help me but continues to make things difficult. Lastly, I had a loss draft claim in the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. The work has been completed and I have called on two different occasions to have an inspection completed along with sending a letter to have someone call me and nothing has happened. In the interim, I continue to get threatening letters that I must have an inspection completed.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is I initially opened my relationship with XXXX XXXXXXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I opened a brokerage Account because my former company closed it's operations. XXXX XXXX opened a brokerage Account and I transferred my securities to them. while opening this Account I was strongly pressed to also open a checking account and a credit card Account. this Account was called a XXXX Account and included 100 free trades in the brokerage Account. the checking Account was to be free of charge, and the credit card was also free of charge and had a reasonable interest rate. after some bad press the problems began. I started to notice that the checking Account was being charged a {$30.00} a month service fee. I closed that Account and requested a refund and was given 2 months credit. then came the withdrawal of the 100 free trades and the imposition of a {$30.00} yearly fee. they also added several new fees and charges, as well as account closing fees. terms of the credit card also changed. I closed the checking and credit card Account. I tolerated this situation for a few years and continued to use the brokerage Account. In XXXX of XXXX I was told that I had XXXX and needed to have them removed. I went to XXXX XXXX and had an exam. I was told that both XXXX were to be done and that I would no longer need XXXX. I was told that the corrections would cost {$1900.00} per XXXX and the cost would be financed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX card with no interest for 36 months. I was misled about the reason for the charges. I was never told that the charges were for an optional additional XXXX procedure. I believed it was a necessary part of the procedure. after the procedure I started the payments and continued until XX/XX/XXXX. I was having trouble with floaters in my eyes and focusing was becoming difficult. when I called the XXXX doctor they immediately denied any responsibility for this problem and told me to see another doctor. I then called XXXX XXXX and questioned the quality of the service and stopped paying. in XXXX of XXXX I believe that XXXX XXXX failed to look into this problem. they never marked the charges as questionable or researched the problem. they reported the Account as delinquent to the credit bureaus. they continued to report this every month with an increasing amount and added late charges as well. as a result my credit scores plunged over 45 points and continued to decline as they continued to report this problem. this is a medical issue and should not have been reported to the bureaus until resolved. they continued to add late charges and they increased the apr. I tried to discuss this with them numerous times to no avail. they were very difficult to get in touch with. several people failed to look into this problem or take steps to resolve this. Then they sent an offer to settle the debt for around {$1500.00}. I am a retired XXXX senior citizen on a fixed income and could not afford it at that time. meanwhile they closed the Account but continued to report the delinquency every month. I have never missed a payment on my mortgage or other credit cards. in fact I have been using XXXX XXXX for over 45 years. I want to obtain a 2nd mortgage or equity line of credit to pay down additional debt and medical bills. I have been turned down by at least 5 banks, credit card companies, and personal finance companies because of their actions. I have over {$400000.00} of equity in my home that I need to access. I need for them to correct their reporting and restate the situation. this has caused major problems with my finances and will result in much higher interest rates wherever I turn. In addition, as a result of their actions my primary bank reduced my credit limit from {$14000.00} to {$2000.00}. this of course resulted in my credit utilization to soar to over 75 percent. nobody will offer me a loan that I desperately need.\n",

And even if the decrease in my credit was wrong Wells Fargo can not restore my credit line because of the forbearance on my mortgage.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.

If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.

Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..\n",
      "VALUE OF S is We called loan care the evening of Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX spoke with one supervisor and two people in the escrow department and one in the insurance department. What happened with our escrow analysis was that it was ran in XXXX as a normal however our insurance company had only sent the XXXX page electronically to them. Loan care treated this as a bill in the same month of XXXX when the hazard insurance was not due until XX/XX/XXXX. Obviously this created a large short fall of our escrow as well as the projected difference for next year as well as the increase in taxes. The total short fall for XXXX should be less than {$200.00}. XXXX hazard insurance amount was {$1000.00} and in XXXX it was {$1000.00}. That is a short fall of {$32.00} for hazard insurance. Taxes in XXXX were {$2800.00} and in XXXX they were XXXX for a shortage of {$150.00}. Total shortage should be {$180.00}. We tried talking with a gentleman in escrow department named XXXX who told us that we can not have a new escrow analysis ran nor could we pay the difference on the new insurance alone. We have asked for a breakdown multiple times of the shortage and nobody is able to provide us that break down. We would just like a new escrow analysis based upon the due date in XXXX for the renewed insurance policy that was paid early on loan cares part or give us a solid number what he shortage of the Insurnace alone for the renewal in order to correct our monthly escrow. Its important to note that every individual we spoke with including the supervisors were unhelpful and unwilling to help claiming that it was not their department or they couldnt run numbers without us sending additional money to deposit in the escrow account and said they did not have access to any of the documents that pertained to our loan for our request.

Representative that assisted me was named XXXX at XXXX. Settlement was with the agreement for XXXX/XXXX to be deleted from my credit report. However 9 months later they have not deleted XXXX from my report and now say there is nothing they can do. My complaint is that deceptive tactics were used to collect money from me at the time of my settlement with XXXX. XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX was deleted and XXXX/XXXX remains on my credit reports. I followed up with XXXX or XXXX and they say they have done their part and deleted XXXX but that there is nothing that can be done with the original creditor XXXX/XXXX which is not what we had agreed to when they took my money or collected. I feel that clearer expectations should have been made prior to collecting on the debt. I was told that XXXX/XXXX would be removed as part of our agreement. Also, Spoke to a Experian representative about inaccurate balance history and the Experian representative said that performing a dispute would be a waste of time for the creditor and that if they did not respond that nothing could be done about the inaccurate balance reporting. The representative specifically said that XXXX has control over the reporting and there is nothing they can do. ( even if I provide evidence to them ) Credit Bureau Experian insists on retaining incorrect balance information even with no response from back from XXXX/XXXX. They summarize their investigation with \" Purchased by another lender. '' Meanwhile XXXX the lender who purchased the account insists that there is nothing they can do about the reporting despite our pay for deletion request and despite incorrect balance reporting.

We faxed a loan satisfaction / release request on XX/XX/XXXX to TCF Bank, and since then this has not been satisfied.

Also, we can never speak with anyone but customer service, as they will never connect us to anyone in the loan / lien department there. We have been given the runaround for over 2 months now, and since then we have not only lost our loan rate lock ( which we paid over {$2500.00} for ), but also months of lost savings from not being able to refinance ( over {$500.00} a month for several months now ).

      "VALUE OF S is This is in response to Select Portfolio Servicing , INC. ( SPS ) CFPB response to complaint XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX. I have several issues/concerns with this response. 1- SPS never addressed the illegal trespassing on private property. 2- SPS 's alleged validation of debt is unacceptable. SPS is a servicer and/or debt collector. SPS is not the alleged note holder and has yet to provide any documentation from the alleged note holder providing proof of their security interest ; i.e. assignment documentation. 3- In the Broker 's Price Opinion ( BPO ) provided in the response by SPS , an \" out building '' was used in the assessment. This building is not even on the property of the subject property that was being assessed. Not to mention the entire BPO is based on the wrong property as described in the mortgage documents. SPS continues to inflate the price of subject property in a fraudulent manner. 4- SPS ' BPO states the subject property has an estimated value of {$100000.00}, yet they forced placed insurance on the property in the amount of {$230000.00} in coverage from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Select Portfolio Servicing , Inc. named as the first insured ( Policy # XXXX ). This is not only unethical, it's illegal. 5- On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX stated they provided me a copy of all origination related documents pertaining to account # XXXX. This was false and a misrepresentation of the facts. The documents included : Customer Application, Loan Agreement Including Truth-in-Lending Disclosure, Notice of Right to Cancel, Recorded Mortgage, Good Faith Estimate, HUD Settlement Statement, Servicing Transfer Disclosure Statement, Hazard Insurance Disclosure, Waiver of Escrow and Origination Appraisal. However, in SPS 's XX/XX/XXXX response they included a document entitled \" Arbitration Rider '' as part of the alleged loan documents. I have never seen this document and XXXX has never provided it to me as a result of my numerous inquiries. As a result, I would like XXXX to explain why it was not sent with the documents requested and provide a copy of the document and any other document ( s ) they neglected to send me in their XX/XX/XXXX correspondence. Either the document does not exist and SPS fabricated it, or XXXX has once again been negligent in performing their duties. Please advise, I continue to assert SPS continues to act in a fraudulent manner and misrepresents their legal abilities as a servicer/debt collector.\n",

I called and requested that they re-send the merchandise and they stated they could only offer a refund and I would need to re-purchase. They initiated the refund for merchandise not received and sent a confirmation email showing that the refund was processed, but after several days of not receiving the refund I contacted Bank of America to start a dispute because I never received the refund they promised. It took 6 months to get a 1st response from BOA stating they were denying it because I went inside the store and made the purchase and they stated that merchandise was obviously received because I made the purchase in store. I then advised BOA, that I did in fact make in in store but never took the merchandise as they had to deliver via online because the stock was not available. At that point they re-investigated the claim with that information and I also forward the the actual email confirmation from XXXX XXXX of the email that was sent to me showing that the return process had been initiated but once again the funds were never disbursed.

      "VALUE OF S is Once again Im submitting my ongoing complaint with Wells Fargo as a follow up to my last formal submission filed on XX/XX/XXXX. Complaint being that back in XXXX I was told that I did in fact qualify for a home modification, but instead of a modification that was designed to keep me in my home I was instead offered a very destructive loan modification as it left all the negative amortization terms and conditions in place while placing all unpaid payments totaling {$12000.00} at the time to the back of the loan with a required {$2500.00} paid upon acceptance of the so call loan modification, which by accepting waived all my legal rights to hold Wells Fargo responsible for supporting such a predatory loan known as the now outlawed Pick-A-Payment loan. When I ask Wells Fargo why they never investigated my compliant with any seriousness, since not once has Well Fargo specialists ever ask me for my then XXXX loan modification financial disclosure documents to see if my then loan to debt ratio was miscalculated or in error, they responded by saying that I didnt meet their criteria that warranted a change to the original Pick-A-Payment note terms. When I asked why no one ever bothered to show me how my mod request financial expenditure data failed to meet the required modification standards that wells Fargo used to determine who qualifies and for what type of loan modification? I was explained to me by Wells Fargos specialist that it was proprietary information, so basically I was to take their word that their investigation found no errors and in compliance Upon pressing their specialist I was told that as reported previously my loan to debt ratio did not warrant a better loan modification as it was determined that I could afford to pay my loan obligations at the time and the modification that was offered to me was simply a courtesy huh, Wells Fargo was throwing me a bone? So basically I was being told that all of my financial troubles and hardship was all made up and a bunch of XXXX I was also informed that a modification is based on income to mortgage loan debt and all other debts were not part of the equation More lies!!! Modifications are based on what is called FRONTS & BACKS See below for an example of how a modification is really calculated. As an example - Debt to Income Ratios HAMP uses a waterfall of modifications with the goal to get the mortgage payment to less than 41 %, but not under 31 % of the monthly gross income of the borrower. This is the Front End Debt to Income Ratio ( Front End DTI ). The mortgage payment, plus all other installment payments and debt payments must not equal more than 55 % of the monthly gross income of the borrower. This is called the Back End Debt to Income Ratio ( Back End DTI ). If a borrower is over 55 %, they are required to obtain HUD-approved counseling. Please keep in mind that I already know Wells Fargo is not conducting a fair and comprehensive investigation into my compliant as again I already know that in XXXX when I submitted my loan modification my front end was 48.0 % and my rear was up to 61.0 % due to my efforts to utilize my dwindling credit to make ends meet. Aside from the fact that the loan at hand that was in the center of a multi-million dollar class action suit that ultimately was settled by Wells Fargo in order to sweep all unjust and destructive Pick-a-Payment loans under the carpet, the facts show that I was treated very unfairly and in total contrast to Wells Fargos ten page Testimony of XXXX XXXX, Operation Manager, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Servicing.

I called to end my service and was told I would have to pay the amount of {$140.00} even though my original contract was with XXXX XXXX and not XXXX XXXX XXXX.

It showed up on my credit report and I did not dispute it. That debt has since been sold to several other debt collection agencies and the info listed was not correct so I disputed it with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX determined it was not accurate and it was removed from my credit report twice by XXXX XXXX from two separate collection agencies. Now it has been sold again to the debt collection agency \" I C System ''. The account was opened with them in XX/XX/XXXX.

I asked XXXX XXXX to send me the original contract and all of my payment history because this is not accurate at all. I am currently awaiting an answer from XXXX XXXX. The investigation was supposed to be finished on XX/XX/XXXX but it is still under investigation over two months after I filed the dispute. It is clear that the debt collection agencies are reselling this debt from XX/XX/XXXX when it gets removed from my credit report and then the new agency that buys the account is listing the account as new when it is an account that is nearing it's statute of limitations. This is fraud. You can not keep a collection account on a credit report by changing the dates to show it as a new account. I have done my due diligence in requesting from both XXXX XXXX as well as IC System to send me the original contract as well as my payment history.

'' The amount of my \" purchases '' was therefore greater than the total of the items I had actually purchased by the amount of the credit. When I spoke to a representative about this, she eventually admitted that yes they did add that carryover credit to my debits, but said then that they deducted the credit from the total. So then we were back to the actual value of my purchases. That would be ok, except that she claimed that the carryover credit had been applied to my balance. Finally she agreed to mail me the credit, but it is clear that if I had not demanded that, Citi was not going to give me back the credit, but they were going to give me the impression that they had applied it to my account.

I already have a XXXX XXXX credit card but they offered an upgrade that I did not get They pulled my report without me being told. This was XX/XX/XXXX. The second involves Loan Depot pulling report when their online add for mortgage rates said \" no need to pull credit \". This was XX/XX/XXXX. After many phone calls to credit reporting companies [ you can't dispute online ] they told me to contact companies directly Guess what?, most popular response was \" I will have to transfer you \" with no results.

      "VALUE OF S is USAA 's credit card department made an illegal withdrawal from my USAA checking account. This withdrawal overdrew my checking account, leading to an increase to the interest rate on my USAA credit card account balance. In XXXX of XXXX, USAAs credit card department notified me of an offer of 0 % APR until XX/XX/XXXX for transactions completed using its promotional checks, and each transaction using a promotional check incurred a {$75.00} fee. On XX/XX/XXXX, I had a XXXX dollar balance on my USAA credit card account, and I subsequently cashed a USAA credit card promotional check for {$17000.00}. After this check settled, my credit card balanced increased from XXXX dollars to {$17000.00}, which includes both the deposit amount and {$75.00} fee. This {$17000.00} balance had a 0 % APR until XX/XX/XXXX. Since that time, I stopped using my USAA card for any purchases or payments. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted USAAs credit card department to change my auto bill pay function to the minimum balance due, and the customer service agent informed me the change took effect immediately. On XX/XX/XXXX, USAAs credit card department made an unauthorized withdrawal from my checking account for {$17000.00} claiming a glitch in its auto pay system, and this withdrawal overdrew my checking account. The overdraw triggered a cash advance from my USAA credit card, and this cash advance from my credit card was at 10 % APR. After many phone calls to USAA and approximately 8 hours + of exchange, both USAAs credit card department and checking department recognized the mistake and reversed the charges, restoring my credit card balance to {$15000.00}. However, USAAs credit card department has failed to correctly restore the 0 % promotional APR to my account, and it is still billing me for cash advance interest charges. I have spoken to its customer service repeatedly, and I have not been given a clear answer if and when this problem will be fixed. I have concerns that this may be systemic fraudulent activity by USAAs credit card department. I have professional experience as an auditor, and Im currently working on my CPA. I believe my background and experience have allowed me to recognize USAA 's bad behavior. However, Im concerned USAA may be cheating those inexperienced with finance by wrongfully increasing APRs on credit card accounts.\n",

They continue to report late payments even though the card is paid in full and closed. This last time they reported 120 day late payments every month from XXXX. This is having a substantial and negative impact on my credit score. I have spent 3 years trying to resolve these issues. They continue to report as if my card were open and I am making late payments. I asked them to look into this account and why it is reporting late and they say the can not find the account and that there is nothing they can do. The told me that all I can do is dispute it with TranUnion. I told them that they are reporting it to TransUnion so they need to fix the problem and stop reporting late payments. They refuse and they will not take responsibility for their problem and fix it. Please help me resolve this issue so XXXX XXXX doesn't continue to report late payments on an account that was paid in full and closed more than 10 years ago. Thank you!\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Over two years ago, my vehicle was totaled and my full coverage insurance did not cover the remaining balance of the car loan.

Two years later, I am receiving harassing phone calls and visits to various addresses that were never provided to this collector. This collector has called my job multiple times and threatened my with arrest. He said that he will visit my house with a sheriff if I do not comply. Note that I have not heard from this loan company in over the years. Also, I called this man back about two weeks ago to try and figure out what was going on, and he told me he sent a letter in the mail explaining everything. I then told him I would read the letter when it came in and take whatever action I needed to solve the issue. However, I never received any letter yet the harassing phone calls have not stopped even though I told the man I wasnt paying any money until I read a physical letter because I believed the situation to be solved years ago when I handed over the vehicle.\n",

I explained to her I paid the {$1500.00} and also paid other cards off/down in order to increase my credit score, and that by lowering my limit they are preventing that, and for them to drop my limit that low was ridiculous, even the first customer service rep made that remark. Her solution was I could request an increase which means they would need to run my credit. She could not explain how they lowered my credit based on my credit report but would need to run my credit again to raise it. They just ran a report supposedly when they lowered it.\n",

I was not aware she was supposed to hand me documents and she forged my signature. Saying yes to be a cosigner were just words, but it being signed and dated by the actual person or to have it in writing by my permission of course are two different things.

I called wells fargo right away to question the how they can charge the high interest rate on A+++ credit and knowing that I have another credit card with them in great standing with a lower rate. I was told that they had no control of the rate and that the dental office has the control to lower it. How is that possible? The dental office had the card number before I even had a chance to get the card in the mail and read over the terms and see the rates. If the office would have let the paperwork and card to be sent to me before they charged it I would not have said no to doing the work. I never signed a credit app or was not aware or told the fees and rate just charged. when I asked the dental office why the whole amount of {$8500.00} was charged before any work was really done I was told that in order to have the teeth impreions made into mouth plates that they needed to be paid in full for them. so I was under the asumsion that the cost for making the mouth plates would be charged only. not the whole amount quoted for \" Phase! '' work which by they way is the same amount of money no matter the patient or work to be done. I also never received an itemized invoice with item and amount for each in plain English so I can understand where the {$8500.00} was spent. I called the dental office and found out that they can or could change my interest rate would even give me 2 years with 0 % if paid in full at the end of 2 years. if not paid in full I would owe all the back interest rate and my rate would go back to the 12.99 %. how is it that the dental office can change or assign the rates and not the lending company? how is it that they can assign credit without looking at the credit score. they run a credit check to check credit but fail to get rates based apon the credit score. i have already closed the account in question and i am disputing the account and charges of {$8500.00}.

I have no doubt that this charge goes back further than that, but I have no way of knowing exactly how far without additional statements. Additionally, after reading the settlement and reviewing emails, I was never contacted by citibank to refund the fees as stated in the XXXX settlement. So, this morning I called to get the matter resolved and was blind transferred by multiple employees in a round-robin ring where no one would take ownership or direct me to who to talk to. Ultimately, I have been hung up on twice. On the last call, where I was finally able to reach a native English speaker, she assured me that she would get me to the right person and not hang up on me. She then requested to put me on hold while she researched, then, without speaking, blind transferred me to a department that, by its title, was responsible for just this issue. They had a touch tone system with 1 and 2 used for prompts. 2 was the options I needed, but instead of transferring me to a person, it looped me back around to the main account status system where it was attempting to look up my account.

      "VALUE OF S is I opened a paypal account back in early XXXX to purchase and retrieve goods online. However, somewhere down the line that paypal account turned into a SYNCB/PAYPAL Credit Card account without my knowledge until I received a credit card in the mail that stated paypal. Long story short all of my transactions appeared to be not coming out of my bank account attached to my paypal account anymore nut towards this card. For a few years I just paid the card account off until one day when trying to log into to pay my bill it stated that I was locked out because I had a huge balance. I called paypal and made a payment but when I tried to get back into the account I still couldn't so I called them and they stated that the payment I made was to the credit card not to my actual paypal account debt which was confusing to me. After like almost 2 hours of back and fourth with several representatives I gave up. Then I started receiving letters with a bill and then one stating that my account had been closed to further purchases until I paid off the balance. Continuously making payments monthly I looked at my credit report and I saw that there was a SYNCB/PAYPAL Credit Card account on it but the account stated that it was closed. However, daily like 4 to 5 times a day I would get calls from them about the debt and I would make minimum payments to keep down the calls until I noticed that they wasn't even reporting it to the credit agencies correctly. I noticed that they would never allow the late payments to go past 90-120 days of me missing payments even if I did ( this was in order to ensure it never gets charged off ). So I called them and asked them about my payments once again the run around stating I had 2 accounts one a normal paypal and a charge card and I still don't understand that. However, when a friend of mine told me about a consumer enforcement that I should have been included on I did some research and I saw that I was enrolled into this additional account which should be cleared. XX/XX/XXXX I received a settlement offer letter from them stating that if I pay a sum of about {$350.00} dollars or somewhere around that figure they would clear the rest and report the account as paid on my credit report. Here it is XX/XX/XXXX and the full balance is still showing unpaid on my credit report and consistently being reported as late to the credit agencies and Paypal still has this account locked to where I cant access it to see anything.\n",

      "VALUE OF S is Good Day! To whom it may concern, On XX/XX/2019 when I was on my business trip I tried using my card to buy food, water, gas and pay for my hotel also other business expenses. Upon review of my account I identified that my funds were missing from my bank account. Where I was located there was a bank branch with in walking distance or my travels. I tried calling the wells Fargo phone number on the back of the card for assistance, I was transferred numerus times. I tried again and finally the representative stated we have to transfer you to our corporate. The corporate representative of wells fargo bank took a minute and stated acknowledgement of unauthorized transaction. She the transfer me again to another phone number. Overall I spend 1 hr.+ on the phone just to speak to a representative then Identified that the my bank account and funds were accessed with out my consent. - {$2000.00} Transaction was coded with an intelligent name \" Legal Order '' through the Clearing houses. Which made almost un traceable. In the business banking and commercial banking world these transaction are the most common type of way accounts are breached. Instead of working honestly they take dishonest step and short cuts to earn money. I requested the representative if there was any security breach in my system or any security breach of my information by 2nd party or 3rd party. She stated \" no ''. The representative stated I don't know. I found this to be very unprofessional by her with respect. She did the best that she could to assist me however any employee of an organization needs to know her responsibility and duties. Prior to receiving an offer letter. Most important she needs to ensure that her customers are happy with her or him. During formal training this information is communicated with every associate of every organization. On XX/XX/2019 at XXXX [ XXXX ] I call the XXXX branch location and made an appointment with the branch manager of the branch name XXXX XXXX . The phone number is +XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX and branch location of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX VA XXXX. I made an appointment of XXXX for the next business day. I arrived to the branch at XXXX on XX/XX/2019 and request to speak with the branch manager. Traveling from XXXX with little over 1hr commute just to make to the appointment on time and she was not present at the branch. This was again shocking and very unprofessional by both Wells Fargo representative and associate ( employee ). Working in banking industry and attending the most prestigious banking university we expect a much greater deal of responsibility and accountability by our employees and associates. The informal treatment was 5 strikes by Wells Fargo and employees. The I went to an alternate location Wells Fargo branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX VA XXXX for assistance. The team was kind and professional about the matter at hand. I work with Ms. XXXX XXXX regarding this Matter. She immediately took accountability of it after hear how my account was breach and funds were missing. We tried working fraudulent party which conducted the crime and coded phone number and coded the name. No luck! We rescheduled for an appointment for XX/XX/2019 at XXXX after her meeting. During my first visit at XXXX she was busy attending her normal calls and admin items. The banker young lady requested for me to come back so we can tackle this problem at hand. I understood and share a reschedule time for about 30 mins later. Ms. XXXX and I worked together to resolve this case by calling the phone number which was coded through the Automated Clearing House and we also attempt calling the internal contact phone numbers of Wells Fargo departments for assistance regarding this Scenario. Then we reviewed the FDIC insurance coverage for each account holder of {$250000.00} USD per account holder. Ms. XXXX excused herself went to the break room and returned back stating that the district manager \" unknown name '' was not able to assist us. How ever upon review of the transaction and FDIC coverage all consumers, businesses, banks, Governments all level and the insurance companies are protected for any direct or indirect damages of up to {$250000.00}. Per name. She agreed and I agreed. Money is easily replaceable we understand this when I train the Federal Judges and Generals which are brought to me for help or assistance. However an unkind experience is difficult to replace. Spending many years in the banking world and training the Federal Government. We always state that money is replaceable.\n",

I was told that even though I had a letter from XXXX that no correction or update on this could be made unless and until received DIRECTLY from XXXX XXXXl. I wen back to XXXX XXXX many many times, by phone, fax and email. I learned eventually XXXX submits to the credit bureau. Eventually I was told XXXX had submitted tot he credit reporting bureaus XX/XX/XXXX then changed toXX/XX/XXXX. I have contacted credit reporting agencies almost daily all say they have not received anything from XXXX and XXXX keeps insisting they have submitted the correction and that \"there is nothing more we can do.\" In turn the credit reporting bureaus keep sending back to XXXX saying they have no record of the correction and removal of these mistaken delinquencies. In desperation I finally submitted the XXXX letter directly to the credit bureaus. Then was told If they hear nothing from XXXX in 30 days matter will be resolved in my favor. By then I will have lost my attempt to apply for financing and my real estate purchase. Decisions on whether to approve a consumer for a loan application and at what interest rate and for what term all hinge on credit reports which for me currently reflect, in error, a major mortgage delinquency with XXXX XXXX\n",

      "VALUE OF S is My husband and I have a rewards travel card with XXXX miles that we planned to use to buy airline tickets for a trip to XXXX this summer. On XX/XX/19 we purchased two XXXX XXXX airline tickets for a total cost of {$1300.00}. On that same day, we cancelled the purchase due to problems with my husbands vacation schedule. We received a full credit of {$1300.00} from XXXX XXXX. Both transactions posted to our account on XX/XX/19. On XX/XX/19, I went online to our account and noticed our card balance was higher than usual. I knew my husband re-booked the airline tickets, so I went to the Travel Statement Credits section of our account where all our qualifying travel-related purchases eligible for redemption are posted. I first read the paragraph there that states, Please note, only qualifying travel purchases made in the last 120 days will display I then saw the XXXX XXXX purchase posted and went ahead and redeemed our miles for what I thought were our airline tickets. What I did not know at the time was that the purchase I had just redeemed was actually the voided purchase we had received full credit for twelve days earlier. Consequently, I had redeemed my miles on an invalid purchase. I did not understand how this could happen, but I trusted there would be no problem in getting our miles back after explaining the circumstances. On XX/XX/19 my husband emailed Customer Service explaining the circumstances and requested our miles be reimbursed. Since we have had this rewards card for many years and have had all positive experiences with the company, we were assured that due to the circumstances the company would be fair and reimburse our miles. On XX/XX/19 Customer Service responded back in an email that stunned us. The answer read as follows : We would like to explain that all redemptions are final. Return credits came in separate amounts which is why transactions of {$1300.00} was still showing as redeemable. As you have mentioned that your wife processed a redemption manually whether which is not a bank error. Statement credit is on the account and will not be reversed. I would like to address these explanations. We understand completely that all redemptions are final and under typical circumstances would fully comply. Nonetheless, because I believed the company statement regarding travel redemption credits to be trustworthy, I redeemed miles on a voided purchase and I believe under these circumstances a redemption should not be considered valid. Regarding the return credits came in separate amounts This doesnt excuse the fact that necessary adjustments were not made in our travel miles redemption. Finally, I do not understand what processing the redemption manually means. I redeemed miles online instead of by phone. On XX/XX/19 after receiving this email, my husband sent a follow-up email expressing our disappointment and dissatisfaction with the decision. On XX/XX/19, I called Customer Service and was told we had to speak with a manager who would be able to resolve our issue and even reverse the decision we got from Customer Service. Finally on XX/XX/19, I spoke with a manager who was pleasant but offered no acceptable explanation for not reimbursing our miles. We went over all of the facts. Most of what the manager said was ambiguous. He told me if it were a matter of only a couple hundred miles, he could do it. When I asked him why it couldnt be done in my case, he said the system isnt set up for it. Throughout the conversation, I felt he wasnt being completely forthcoming and in the end, I got an apology. We ask that this matter be reassessed in fairness on our behalf and would appreciate a different and more favorable outcome.\n",

You can look in the national data base and see all of my loans and all of my information. You can also look into the military side of things. This is not hard.

They violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ( SCRA ) and did not defer some of my loans. They would not listen to me when I tried to explain even though it is in black and white when you look at my account in the department of education national data base. The collections department is constantly calling from different numbers. They call my cell phone, my work and then they are hanging up, threatening, threatening to garnish my wages. I believe this is not only harassment, a violation of ones rights and fraud, it is also a federal crime to a service members right to be protected from such actions. I have written proof. I have proof they were notified. I have proof that they own both of my student loans one in which was placed in deferment appropriately and is still in good standing. They have dropped the ball. All I have wanted was them to take all that outstanding interest off, consolidate and fix those loans, take off all those fraudulent reports on my credit so I can try to begin a more normal life again.

In the meantime, a conditional credit was being added back to my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to XXXX to follow up. She returned my call and let me know that she could see that the merchant had provided documentation that did NOT pertain to my transaction. She explained that she would have to follow up with the merchant allow them time to respond. Today is XX/XX/XXXX. I have left voicemails for XXXX twice this week. If she's on vacation, her voicemail recording does not mention it. I have not heard from her since our conversation at the end of XXXX and the dispute center lists the dispute as \" IN PROGRESS ''. It is my opinion that the documentation I provided is thorough and complete. The merchant has had ample time to respond with ACCURATE material and Citi Cards has had more than enough time to resolve this dispute.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is Problem with Citibank , N.A . In XX/XX/2019 I opened three savings accounts via an online application from their solicitation advertising an interest rate of 2.33 %. I funded the accounts using the Citibank process for account to account transfers from my credit union account in XXXX, NM by following the instructions from Citibank. The transfer of funds went well. On my first bank statement I received in XX/XX/XXXX I noticed Citibank was withholding for federal taxes with the information on my statement saying, \" Federal Withholding Tax Uncertified ''. I called Citibank inXX/XX/2019 and inquired about the withholding and was informed I need to submit a W-9 and they directed me to the IRS website to obtain the form. I asked how I could submit the form and was told to fax it in. I followed the directions and submitted the form via the fax number they provided. XXXX weeks later, I called Citibank and asked if the form was received. I was told by the Citibank representative the forms could not be faxed in and had to be mailed! I followed these contradictory instructions and mailed in the form to the address I was provided in early XX/XX/2019. I was told to wait three weeks for processing. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank, and after a long wait on hold time, and after explaining the problem ( again ) I was transferred to their servicing department. The message was the department was closed and I should leave a message and they would respond the next business day. I left detailed information about my name, SSN, account numbers and the reason for my call. I left a daytime phone number and repeated the number, including area code three different times for clarity. No one ever called me back or took care of the issue of my interest being withheld. In early XXXX I received my bank statement and noticed interest was still being withheld for taxes, telling me they have not processed either of the forms I submitted. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank and spoke with a representative and told them my story ( again ) and was told I need to talk with a supervisor. They placed me on hold and forgot about me. After 45 minutes of long suffering, I hung up the phone. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank again and after entering all the information about my account on the phone and waiting through the phone menus, the message came on they are too busy to talk to me and told me to call back in two hours then they hung up on me. On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked online and all three of my accounts are having interest withheld even through I submitted W-9 two different times according to their instructions.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is I don't recognize this credit inquiry nor did i allow it.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is There is a hard inquiry on my credit report from a credit card/airline credit card company called Syncb. I never applied for anything.\n",
      "VALUE OF S is XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted {$250.00} with my application for a \" USAA Secured Card Platinum Visa card. '' The card was received with a letter stating \" ... more ways your card is working for you : -- helping you build/rebuild your credit. '' My credit limit is {$250.00}. The CD matures XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I rang USAA, and spoke with \" XXXX. '' She informed me that \" closing the CD would close my credit card. '' XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from USAA stating \" your CD ... will soon mature. If no action is taken, your account will automatically renew in a CD with a similar term. '' XX/XX/XXXX, I rang USAA, and spoke with \" XXXX. '' He restated what \" XXXX '' had previously said. I was then transferred to \" XXXX '', who was *supposed* to be a \" credit card specialist. '' In fact, \" XXXX '' is in the \" new accounts '' department. She stated that there is no procedure whereby my account could be \" graduated '' OR \" converted '' to an \" unsecured card. '' Furthermore, my {$250.00} CD will be applied directly to the outstanding balance. It is worth noting that the cumulative amount of interest paid on my CD ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) = {$2.00}!!! My payments have been made on a timely basis, automatically withdrawn from the same checking account, are usually above the minimum amount, and my balance has NOT exceeded {$250.00}. Closing my account will negatively impact my credit score -- contrary to the very reason I opened the account in the first place!!! In contrast ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I submitted {$150.00} with my application for a \" XXXX XXXX Secured MasterCard '', and a credit line of {$200.00}. XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my credit line had been INCREASED to {$600.00}. I rang XXXX XXXX, to confirm that a mistake hadn't been made. I was informed that they proactively review accounts, my account was \" in good standing '' and my payment history justified the increase. Upon receipt of the notification from USAA, I once again rang XXXX XXXX. \" XXXX ' '' informed me that the CD security is held for the \" life of my card. '' However, XXXX XXXX ALSO proactively reviews accounts, my account *can be* \" upgraded '', and the CD released to me. Had I been advised that my {$250.00} would be held indefinitely, I would NEVER have opened an account with USAA. Furthermore, 2 years is most certainly sufficient time for USAA to recognize my credit \" worthiness. '' Indeed, XXXX XXXX made such a decision after only 6 months!!! USAA is, once again, engaging in unconscionable predatory practices. Reference prior CFPB complaint XXXX, wherein a \" defender hold '' was placed on my payment for 10 days, and I was accused of \" money laundering. '' I have been a USAA member for 29 years, and am currently facing a lose-lose proposition. My credit rating will be irreparably damaged. USAA 's ( current ) slogan is \" good enough is NOT good enough. '' Indeed, USAA is NOT EVEN \" good. ''\n"
